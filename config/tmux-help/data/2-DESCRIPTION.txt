DESCRIPTION
       tmux  is  a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background,
       then later reattached.

       When tmux is started, it creates a new session with a single window and displays it on screen.  A status line at the bottom of the screen shows information on the current session and is used to enter  in‐
       teractive commands.

       A  session is a single collection of pseudo terminals under the management of tmux.  Each session has one or more windows linked to it.  A window occupies the entire screen and may be split into rectangu‐
       lar panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the pty(4) manual page documents the technical details of pseudo terminals).  Any number of tmux instances may connect to the same session, and  any
       number of windows may be present in the same session.  Once all sessions are killed, tmux exits.

       Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as ssh(1) connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the ‘C-b d’ key strokes).  tmux may be reattached using:

             $ tmux attach

       In tmux, a session is displayed on screen by a client and all sessions are managed by a single server.  The server and each client are separate processes which communicate through a socket in /tmp.

       The options are as follows:

       -2            Force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.  This is equivalent to -T 256.

       -C            Start in control mode (see the “CONTROL MODE” section).  Given twice (-CC) disables echo.

       -c shell-command
                     Execute  shell-command using the default shell.  If necessary, the tmux server will be started to retrieve the default-shell option.  This option is for compatibility with sh(1) when tmux is
                     used as a login shell.

       -D            Do not start the tmux server as a daemon.  This also turns the exit-empty option off.  With -D, command may not be specified.

       -f file       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, tmux loads the system configuration file from /etc/tmux.conf, if present, then looks for a user configuration  file  at  ~/.tmux.conf,
                     $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf or ~/.tmux.conf.

                     The  configuration  file  is a set of tmux commands which are executed in sequence when the server is first started.  tmux loads configuration files once when the server process has started.
                     The source-file command may be used to load a file later.

                     tmux shows any error messages from commands in configuration files in the first session created, and continues to process the rest of the configuration file.

       -L socket-name
                     tmux stores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR or /tmp if it is unset.  The default socket is named default.  This option allows a different socket name to be specified,  al‐
                     lowing several independent tmux servers to be run.  Unlike -S a full path is not necessary: the sockets are all created in a directory tmux-UID under the directory given by TMUX_TMPDIR or in
                     /tmp.  The tmux-UID directory is created by tmux and must not be world readable, writable or executable.

                     If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the tmux server process to recreate it (note that this will fail if any parent directories are missing).

       -l            Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.

       -N            Do not start the server even if the command would normally do so (for example new-session or start-server).

       -S socket-path
                     Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If -S is specified, the default socket directory is not used and any -L flag is ignored.

       -T features   Set terminal features for the client.  This is a comma-separated list of features.  See the terminal-features option.

       -u            Write UTF-8 output to the terminal even if the first environment variable of LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG that is set does not contain "UTF-8" or "UTF8".

       -V            Report the tmux version.

       -v            Request  verbose  logging.   Log messages will be saved into tmux-client-PID.log and tmux-server-PID.log files in the current directory, where PID is the PID of the server or client process.
                     If -v is specified twice, an additional tmux-out-PID.log file is generated with a copy of everything tmux writes to the terminal.

                     The SIGUSR2 signal may be sent to the tmux server process to toggle logging between on (as if -v was given) and off.

       command [flags]
                     This specifies one of a set of commands used to control tmux, as described in the following sections.  If no commands are specified, the new-session command is assumed.
