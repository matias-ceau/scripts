KEY BINDINGS
       tmux allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix key.  When specifying keys, most represent themselves (for example ‘A’ to ‘Z’).  Ctrl keys may be prefixed with ‘C-’ or ‘^’,  Shift
       keys  with  ‘S-’  and  Alt (meta) with ‘M-’.  In addition, the following special key names are accepted: Up, Down, Left, Right, BSpace, BTab, DC (Delete), End, Enter, Escape, F1 to F12, Home, IC (Insert),
       NPage/PageDown/PgDn, PPage/PageUp/PgUp, Space, and Tab.  Note that to bind the ‘"’ or ‘'’ keys, quotation marks are necessary, for example:

             bind-key '"' split-window
             bind-key "'" new-window

       A command bound to the Any key will execute for all keys which do not have a more specific binding.

       Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

       bind-key [-nr] [-N note] [-T key-table] key command [argument ...]
                     (alias: bind)
               Bind key key to command.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By default (without -T), the key is bound in the prefix key table.  This table is used for keys pressed after the prefix key (for example,
               by default ‘c’ is bound to new-window in the prefix table, so ‘C-b c’ creates a new window).  The root table is used for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding ‘c’ to new-window in the  root
               table  (not  recommended)  means  a plain ‘c’ will create a new window.  -n is an alias for -T root.  Keys may also be bound in custom key tables and the switch-client -T command used to switch to
               them from a key binding.  The -r flag indicates this key may repeat, see the repeat-time option.  -N attaches a note to the key (shown with list-keys -N).

               To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the list-keys command.

       list-keys [-1aN] [-P prefix-string -T key-table] [key]
                     (alias: lsk)
               List key bindings.  There are two forms: the default lists keys as bind-key commands; -N lists only keys with attached notes and shows only the key and note for each key.

               With the default form, all key tables are listed by default.  -T lists only keys in key-table.

               With the -N form, only keys in the root and prefix key tables are listed by default; -T also lists only keys in key-table.  -P specifies a prefix to print before each key and  -1  lists  only  the
               first matching key.  -a lists the command for keys that do not have a note rather than skipping them.

       send-keys [-FHKlMRX] [-c target-client] [-N repeat-count] [-t target-pane] key ...
                     (alias: send)
               Send  a key or keys to a window or client.  Each argument key is the name of the key (such as ‘C-a’ or ‘NPage’) to send; if the string is not recognised as a key, it is sent as a series of charac‐
               ters.  If -K is given, keys are sent to target-client, so they are looked up in the client's key table, rather than to target-pane.  All arguments are sent sequentially from first to last.  If  no
               keys are given and the command is bound to a key, then that key is used.

               The -l flag disables key name lookup and processes the keys as literal UTF-8 characters.  The -H flag expects each key to be a hexadecimal number for an ASCII character.

               The -R flag causes the terminal state to be reset.

               -M passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see “MOUSE SUPPORT”).

               -X is used to send a command into copy mode - see the “WINDOWS AND PANES” section.  -N specifies a repeat count and -F expands formats in arguments where appropriate.

       send-prefix [-2] [-t target-pane]
               Send the prefix key, or with -2 the secondary prefix key, to a window as if it was pressed.

       unbind-key [-anq] [-T key-table] key
                     (alias: unbind)
               Unbind the command bound to key.  -n and -T are the same as for bind-key.  If -a is present, all key bindings are removed.  The -q option prevents errors being returned.
