WINDOWS AND PANES
       Each window displayed by tmux may be split into one or more panes; each pane takes up a certain area of the display and is a separate terminal.  A window may be split into  panes  using  the  split-window
       command.   Windows may be split horizontally (with the -h flag) or vertically.  Panes may be resized with the resize-pane command (bound to ‘C-Up’, ‘C-Down’ ‘C-Left’ and ‘C-Right’ by default), the current
       pane may be changed with the select-pane command and the rotate-window and swap-pane commands may be used to swap panes without changing their position.  Panes are numbered beginning from zero in the  or‐
       der they are created.

       By default, a tmux pane permits direct access to the terminal contained in the pane.  A pane may also be put into one of several modes:

             -   Copy  mode,  which permits a section of a window or its history to be copied to a paste buffer for later insertion into another window.  This mode is entered with the copy-mode command, bound to
                 ‘[’ by default.  Copied text can be pasted with the paste-buffer command, bound to ‘]’.

             -   View mode, which is like copy mode but is entered when a command that produces output, such as list-keys, is executed from a key binding.

             -   Choose mode, which allows an item to be chosen from a list.  This may be a client, a session or window or pane, or a buffer.  This mode is  entered  with  the  choose-buffer,  choose-client  and
                 choose-tree commands.

       In copy mode an indicator is displayed in the top-right corner of the pane with the current position and the number of lines in the history.

       Commands  are  sent  to  copy  mode using the -X flag to the send-keys command.  When a key is pressed, copy mode automatically uses one of two key tables, depending on the mode-keys option: copy-mode for
       emacs, or copy-mode-vi for vi.  Key tables may be viewed with the list-keys command.

       The following commands are supported in copy mode:

       append-selection
               Append the selection to the top paste buffer.

       append-selection-and-cancel (vi: A)
               Append the selection to the top paste buffer and exit copy mode.

       back-to-indentation (vi: ^) (emacs: M-m)
               Move the cursor back to the indentation.

       start-of-line (vi: 0) (emacs: C-a)
               Move the cursor to the start of the line.

       top-line (vi: H) (emacs: M-R)
               Move to the top line.

       The search commands come in several varieties: ‘search-forward’ and ‘search-backward’ search for a regular expression; the ‘-text’ variants search for a plain text string rather than a regular expression;
       ‘-incremental’ perform an incremental search and expect to be used with the -i flag to the command-prompt command.  ‘search-again’ repeats the last search and ‘search-reverse’ does the same  but  reverses
       the direction (forward becomes backward and backward becomes forward).

       The ‘next-prompt’ and ‘previous-prompt’ move between shell prompts, but require the shell to emit an escape sequence (\033]133;A\033\\) to tell tmux where the prompts are located; if the shell does not do
       this, these commands will do nothing.  The -o flag jumps to the beginning of the command output instead of the shell prompt.

       Copy  commands  may  take  an optional buffer prefix argument which is used to generate the buffer name (the default is ‘buffer’ so buffers are named ‘buffer0’, ‘buffer1’ and so on).  Pipe commands take a
       command argument which is the command to which the selected text is piped.  ‘copy-pipe’ variants also copy the selection.  The ‘-and-cancel’ variants of some commands exit copy mode after they  have  com‐
       pleted (for copy commands) or when the cursor reaches the bottom (for scrolling commands).  ‘-no-clear’ variants do not clear the selection.

       The next and previous word keys skip over whitespace and treat consecutive runs of either word separators or other letters as words.  Word separators can be customized with the word-separators session op‐
       tion.   Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the end of the next word and previous word to the start of the previous word.  The three next and previous space keys work similarly
       but use a space alone as the word separator.  Setting word-separators to the empty string makes next/previous word equivalent to next/previous space.

       The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For instance, typing ‘f’ followed by ‘/’ will move the cursor to the next ‘/’ character on the current line.  A ‘;’ will then jump to the  next  oc‐
       currence.

       Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.  With vi key bindings, a prefix is entered using the number keys; with emacs, the Alt (meta) key and a number begins prefix entry.

       The synopsis for the copy-mode command is:

       copy-mode [-eHMqu] [-s src-pane] [-t target-pane]
               Enter  copy  mode.  The -u option scrolls one page up.  -M begins a mouse drag (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see “MOUSE SUPPORT”).  -H hides the position indicator in the top right.
               -q cancels copy mode and any other modes.  -s copies from src-pane instead of target-pane.

               -e specifies that scrolling to the bottom of the history (to the visible screen) should exit copy mode.  While in copy mode, pressing a key other than those used for scrolling  will  disable  this
               behaviour.  This is intended to allow fast scrolling through a pane's history, for example with:

                     bind PageUp copy-mode -eu

       A  number  of  preset  arrangements of panes are available, these are called layouts.  These may be selected with the select-layout command or cycled with next-layout (bound to ‘Space’ by default); once a
       layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized as normal.

       The following layouts are supported:

       even-horizontal
               Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

       even-vertical
               Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

       main-horizontal
               A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes are spread from left to right in the leftover space at the bottom.  Use the main-pane-height window option to  specify
               the height of the top pane.

       main-vertical
               Similar to main-horizontal but the large pane is placed on the left and the others spread from top to bottom along the right.  See the main-pane-width window option.

       tiled   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and columns.

       In addition, select-layout may be used to apply a previously used layout - the list-windows command displays the layout of each window in a form suitable for use with select-layout.  For example:

             $ tmux list-windows
             0: ksh [159x48]
                 layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
             $ tmux select-layout 'bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}'

       tmux automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size.  Note that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes than that from which the layout was originally defined.

       Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

       break-pane [-abdP] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-window]
                     (alias: breakp)
               Break  src-pane  off  from its containing window to make it the only pane in dst-window.  With -a or -b, the window is moved to the next index after or before (existing windows are moved if neces‐
               sary).  If -d is given, the new window does not become the current window.  The -P option prints information about the new window after it has  been  created.   By  default,  it  uses  the  format
               ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}.#{pane_index}’ but a different format may be specified with -F.

       capture-pane [-aAepPqCJN] [-b buffer-name] [-E end-line] [-S start-line] [-t target-pane]
                     (alias: capturep)
               Capture the contents of a pane.  If -p is given, the output goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified with -b or a new buffer if omitted.  If -a is given, the alternate screen is used, and
               the  history  is not accessible.  If no alternate screen exists, an error will be returned unless -q is given.  If -e is given, the output includes escape sequences for text and background attrib‐
               utes.  -C also escapes non-printable characters as octal \xxx.  -T ignores trailing positions that do not contain a character.  -N preserves trailing spaces at each line's  end  and  -J  preserves
               trailing spaces and joins any wrapped lines; -J implies -T.  -P captures only any output that the pane has received that is the beginning of an as-yet incomplete escape sequence.

               -S  and  -E specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first line of the visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.  ‘-’ to -S is the start of the history and to -E
               the end of the visible pane.  The default is to capture only the visible contents of the pane.

       choose-client [-NrZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-K key-format] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane] [template]
               Put a pane into client mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from a list.  Each client is shown on one line.  A shortcut key is shown on the left in brackets allowing for  immediate
               choice, or the list may be navigated and an item chosen or otherwise manipulated using the keys below.  -Z zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in client mode:

                     Key    Function
                     Enter  Choose selected client
                     Up     Select previous client
                     Down   Select next client
                     C-s    Search by name
                     n      Repeat last search
                     t      Toggle if client is tagged
                     T      Tag no clients
                     C-t    Tag all clients
                     d      Detach selected client
                     D      Detach tagged clients
                     x      Detach and HUP selected client
                     X      Detach and HUP tagged clients
                     z      Suspend selected client
                     Z      Suspend tagged clients
                     f      Enter a format to filter items
                     O      Change sort field
                     r      Reverse sort order
                     v      Toggle preview
                     q      Exit mode

               After a client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client name in template and the result executed as a command.  If template is not given, "detach-client -t '%%'" is used.

               -O  specifies  the  initial sort field: one of ‘name’, ‘size’, ‘creation’ (time), or ‘activity’ (time).  -r reverses the sort order.  -f specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it
               evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the format for each item in the list  and  -K  a
               format for each shortcut key; both are evaluated once for each line.  -N starts without the preview.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

       choose-tree [-GNrswZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-K key-format] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane] [template]
               Put  a  pane  into  tree  mode, where a session, window or pane may be chosen interactively from a tree.  Each session, window or pane is shown on one line.  A shortcut key is shown on the left in
               brackets allowing for immediate choice, or the tree may be navigated and an item chosen or otherwise manipulated using the keys below.  -s starts with sessions collapsed and -w with  windows  col‐
               lapsed.  -Z zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in tree mode:

                     Key    Function
                     Enter  Choose selected item
                     Up     Select previous item
                     Down   Select next item
                     +      Expand selected item
                     -      Collapse selected item
                     M-+    Expand all items
                     M--    Collapse all items
                     x      Kill selected item
                     X      Kill tagged items
                     <      Scroll list of previews left
                     >      Scroll list of previews right
                     C-s    Search by name
                     m      Set the marked pane
                     M      Clear the marked pane
                     n      Repeat last search
                     t      Toggle if item is tagged
                     T      Tag no items
                     C-t    Tag all items
                     :      Run a command for each tagged item
                     f      Enter a format to filter items
                     H      Jump to the starting pane
                     O      Change sort field
                     r      Reverse sort order
                     v      Toggle preview
                     q      Exit mode

               After  a  session,  window  or pane is chosen, the first instance of ‘%%’ and all instances of ‘%1’ are replaced by the target in template and the result executed as a command.  If template is not
               given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.

               -O specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘index’, ‘name’, or ‘time’ (activity).  -r reverses the sort order.  -f specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates  to  zero,
               the  item  in  the  list  is  not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the format for each item in the tree and -K a format for each
               shortcut key; both are evaluated once for each line.  -N starts without the preview.  -G includes all sessions in any session groups in the tree rather than only the  first.   This  command  works
               only if at least one client is attached.

       customize-mode [-NZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-t target-pane] [template]
               Put  a  pane  into customize mode, where options and key bindings may be browsed and modified from a list.  Option values in the list are shown for the active pane in the current window.  -Z zooms
               the pane.  The following keys may be used in customize mode:

                     Key    Function
                     Enter  Set pane, window, session or global option value
                     Up     Select previous item
                     Down   Select next item
                     +      Expand selected item
                     -      Collapse selected item
                     M-+    Expand all items
                     M--    Collapse all items
                     s      Set option value or key attribute
                     S      Set global option value
                     w      Set window option value, if option is for pane and window
                     d      Set an option or key to the default
                     D      Set tagged options and tagged keys to the default
                     u      Unset an option (set to default value if global) or unbind a key
                     U      Unset tagged options and unbind tagged keys
                     C-s    Search by name
                     n      Repeat last search
                     t      Toggle if item is tagged
                     T      Tag no items
                     C-t    Tag all items

                     v      Toggle option information
                     q      Exit mode

               -f specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.
               -F specifies the format for each item in the tree.  -N starts without the option information.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

       display-panes [-bN] [-d duration] [-t target-client] [template]
                     (alias: displayp)
               Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by target-client.  See the display-panes-colour and display-panes-active-colour session options.  The indicator is closed when a key is pressed  (un‐
               less  -N is given) or duration milliseconds have passed.  If -d is not given, display-panes-time is used.  A duration of zero means the indicator stays until a key is pressed.  While the indicator
               is on screen, a pane may be chosen with the ‘0’ to ‘9’ keys, which will cause template to be executed as a command with ‘%%’ substituted by the pane ID.  The default template  is  "select-pane  -t
               '%%'".  With -b, other commands are not blocked from running until the indicator is closed.

       find-window [-iCNrTZ] [-t target-pane] match-string
                     (alias: findw)
               Search  for  a fnmatch(3) pattern or, with -r, regular expression match-string in window names, titles, and visible content (but not history).  The flags control matching behavior: -C matches only
               visible window contents, -N matches only the window name and -T matches only the window title.  -i makes the search ignore case.  The default is -CNT.  -Z zooms the pane.

               This command works only if at least one client is attached.

       join-pane [-bdfhv] [-l size] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
                     (alias: joinp)
               Like split-window, but instead of splitting dst-pane and creating a new pane, split it and move src-pane into the space.  This can be used to reverse break-pane.  The -b option causes src-pane  to
               be joined to left of or above dst-pane.

               If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

       kill-pane [-a] [-t target-pane]
                     (alias: killp)
               Destroy the given pane.  If no panes remain in the containing window, it is also destroyed.  The -a option kills all but the pane given with -t.

       kill-window [-a] [-t target-window]
                     (alias: killw)
               Kill the current window or the window at target-window, removing it from any sessions to which it is linked.  The -a option kills all but the window given with -t.

       last-pane [-deZ] [-t target-window]
                     (alias: lastp)
               Select the last (previously selected) pane.  -Z keeps the window zoomed if it was zoomed.  -e enables or -d disables input to the pane.

       last-window [-t target-session]
                     (alias: last)
               Select the last (previously selected) window.  If no target-session is specified, select the last window of the current session.

       link-window [-abdk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
                     (alias: linkw)
               Link the window at src-window to the specified dst-window.  If dst-window is specified and no such window exists, the src-window is linked there.  With -a or -b the window is moved to the next in‐
               dex  after  or  before dst-window (existing windows are moved if necessary).  If -k is given and dst-window exists, it is killed, otherwise an error is generated.  If -d is given, the newly linked
               window is not selected.

       list-panes [-as] [-F format] [-f filter] [-t target]
                     (alias: lsp)
               If -a is given, target is ignored and all panes on the server are listed.  If -s is given, target is a session (or the current session).  If neither is given, target is a window  (or  the  current
               window).  -F specifies the format of each line and -f a filter.  Only panes for which the filter is true are shown.  See the “FORMATS” section.

       list-windows [-a] [-F format] [-f filter] [-t target-session]
                     (alias: lsw)
               If -a is given, list all windows on the server.  Otherwise, list windows in the current session or in target-session.  -F specifies the format of each line and -f a filter.  Only windows for which
               the filter is true are shown.  See the “FORMATS” section.

       move-pane [-bdfhv] [-l size] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
                     (alias: movep)
               Does the same as join-pane.

       move-window [-abrdk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
                     (alias: movew)
               This is similar to link-window, except the window at src-window is moved to dst-window.  With -r, all windows in the session are renumbered in sequential order, respecting the base-index option.

       new-window [-abdkPS] [-c start-directory] [-e environment] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-t target-window] [shell-command]
                     (alias: neww)
               Create  a  new  window.  With -a or -b, the new window is inserted at the next index after or before the specified target-window, moving windows up if necessary; otherwise target-window is the new
               window location.

               If -d is given, the session does not make the new window the current window.  target-window represents the window to be created; if the target already exists an error is shown, unless the -k  flag
               is used, in which case it is destroyed.  If -S is given and a window named window-name already exists, it is selected (unless -d is also given in which case the command does nothing).

               shell-command  is  the  command to execute.  If shell-command is not specified, the value of the default-command option is used.  -c specifies the working directory in which the new window is cre‐
               ated.

               When the shell command completes, the window closes.  See the remain-on-exit option to change this behaviour.

               -e takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an environment variable for the newly created window; it may be specified multiple times.

               The TERM environment variable must be set to ‘screen’ or ‘tmux’ for all programs running inside tmux.  New windows will automatically have ‘TERM=screen’ added to their environment, but  care  must
               be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files or by the -e option.

               The -P option prints information about the new window after it has been created.  By default, it uses the format ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may be specified with -F.

       next-layout [-t target-window]
                     (alias: nextl)
               Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to fit.

       next-window [-a] [-t target-session]
                     (alias: next)
               Move to the next window in the session.  If -a is used, move to the next window with an alert.

       pipe-pane [-IOo] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
                     (alias: pipep)
               Pipe  output  sent  by the program in target-pane to a shell command or vice versa.  A pane may only be connected to one command at a time, any existing pipe is closed before shell-command is exe‐
               cuted.  The shell-command string may contain the special character sequences supported by the status-left option.  If no shell-command is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.

               -I and -O specify which of the shell-command output streams are connected to the pane: with -I stdout is connected (so anything shell-command prints is written to the pane as if  it  were  typed);
               with -O stdin is connected (so any output in the pane is piped to shell-command).  Both may be used together and if neither are specified, -O is used.

               The -o option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a pipe to be toggled with a single key, for example:

                     bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat >>~/output.#I-#P'

       previous-layout [-t target-window]
                     (alias: prevl)
               Move to the previous layout in the session.

       previous-window [-a] [-t target-session]
                     (alias: prev)
               Move to the previous window in the session.  With -a, move to the previous window with an alert.

       rename-window [-t target-window] new-name
                     (alias: renamew)
               Rename the current window, or the window at target-window if specified, to new-name.

       resize-pane [-DLMRTUZ] [-t target-pane] [-x width] [-y height] [adjustment]
                     (alias: resizep)
               Resize  a pane, up, down, left or right by adjustment with -U, -D, -L or -R, or to an absolute size with -x or -y.  The adjustment is given in lines or columns (the default is 1); -x and -y may be
               a given as a number of lines or columns or followed by ‘%’ for a percentage of the window size (for example ‘-x 10%’).  With -Z, the active pane is toggled between zoomed (occupying the  whole  of
               the window) and unzoomed (its normal position in the layout).

               -M begins mouse resizing (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see “MOUSE SUPPORT”).

               -T trims all lines below the current cursor position and moves lines out of the history to replace them.

       resize-window [-aADLRU] [-t target-window] [-x width] [-y height] [adjustment]
                     (alias: resizew)
               Resize a window, up, down, left or right by adjustment with -U, -D, -L or -R, or to an absolute size with -x or -y.  The adjustment is given in lines or cells (the default is 1).  -A sets the size
               of the largest session containing the window; -a the size of the smallest.  This command will automatically set window-size to manual in the window options.

       respawn-pane [-k] [-c start-directory] [-e environment] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
                     (alias: respawnp)
               Reactivate  a pane in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit window option).  If shell-command is not given, the command used when the pane was created or last respawned is executed.
               The pane must be already inactive, unless -k is given, in which case any existing command is killed.  -c specifies a new working directory for the pane.  The -e option has the same meaning as  for
               the new-window command.

       respawn-window [-k] [-c start-directory] [-e environment] [-t target-window] [shell-command]
                     (alias: respawnw)
               Reactivate  a  window in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit window option).  If shell-command is not given, the command used when the window was created or last respawned is exe‐
               cuted.  The window must be already inactive, unless -k is given, in which case any existing command is killed.  -c specifies a new working directory for the window.  The -e  option  has  the  same
               meaning as for the new-window command.

       rotate-window [-DUZ] [-t target-window]
                     (alias: rotatew)
               Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either upward (numerically lower) with -U or downward (numerically higher).  -Z keeps the window zoomed if it was zoomed.

       select-layout [-Enop] [-t target-pane] [layout-name]
                     (alias: selectl)
               Choose  a  specific layout for a window.  If layout-name is not given, the last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied.  -n and -p are equivalent to the next-layout and previous-layout commands.
               -o applies the last set layout if possible (undoes the most recent layout change).  -E spreads the current pane and any panes next to it out evenly.

       select-pane [-DdeLlMmRUZ] [-T title] [-t target-pane]
                     (alias: selectp)
               Make pane target-pane the active pane in its window.  If one of -D, -L, -R, or -U is used, respectively the pane below, to the left, to the right, or above the target pane is used.  -Z  keeps  the
               window zoomed if it was zoomed.  -l is the same as using the last-pane command.  -e enables or -d disables input to the pane.  -T sets the pane title.

               -m  and  -M  are  used to set and clear the marked pane.  There is one marked pane at a time, setting a new marked pane clears the last.  The marked pane is the default target for -s to join-pane,
               move-pane, swap-pane and swap-window.

       select-window [-lnpT] [-t target-window]
                     (alias: selectw)
               Select the window at target-window.  -l, -n and -p are equivalent to the last-window, next-window and previous-window commands.  If -T is given and the selected window is already the current  win‐
               dow, the command behaves like last-window.

       split-window [-bdfhIvPZ] [-c start-directory] [-e environment] [-l size] [-t target-pane] [shell-command] [-F format]
                     (alias: splitw)
               Create  a  new pane by splitting target-pane: -h does a horizontal split and -v a vertical split; if neither is specified, -v is assumed.  The -l option specifies the size of the new pane in lines
               (for vertical split) or in columns (for horizontal split); size may be followed by ‘%’ to specify a percentage of the available space.  The -b option causes the new pane to be created to the  left
               of  or  above target-pane.  The -f option creates a new pane spanning the full window height (with -h) or full window width (with -v), instead of splitting the active pane.  -Z zooms if the window
               is not zoomed, or keeps it zoomed if already zoomed.

               An empty shell-command ('') will create a pane with no command running in it.  Output can be sent to such a pane with the display-message command.  The -I flag (if shell-command is  not  specified
               or empty) will create an empty pane and forward any output from stdin to it.  For example:

                     $ make 2>&1|tmux splitw -dI &

               All other options have the same meaning as for the new-window command.

       swap-pane [-dDUZ] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
                     (alias: swapp)
               Swap  two panes.  If -U is used and no source pane is specified with -s, dst-pane is swapped with the previous pane (before it numerically); -D swaps with the next pane (after it numerically).  -d
               instructs tmux not to change the active pane and -Z keeps the window zoomed if it was zoomed.

               If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

       swap-window [-d] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
                     (alias: swapw)
               This is similar to link-window, except the source and destination windows are swapped.  It is an error if no window exists at src-window.  If -d is given, the new window does not become  the  cur‐
               rent window.

               If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the window containing the marked pane is used rather than the current window.

       unlink-window [-k] [-t target-window]
                     (alias: unlinkw)
               Unlink  target-window.   Unless  -k  is  given,  a window may be unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions - windows may not be linked to no sessions; if -k is specified and the window is
               linked to only one session, it is unlinked and destroyed.
