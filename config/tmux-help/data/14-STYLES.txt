STYLES
       tmux offers various options to specify the colour and attributes of aspects of the interface, for example status-style for the status line.  In addition, embedded styles may be  specified  in  format  op‐
       tions, such as status-left, by enclosing them in ‘#[’ and ‘]’.

       A style may be the single term ‘default’ to specify the default style (which may come from an option, for example status-style in the status line) or a space or comma separated list of the following:

       fg=colour
               Set the foreground colour.  The colour is one of: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white; if supported the bright variants brightred, brightgreen, brightyellow; colour0 to colour255
               from the 256-colour set; default for the default colour; terminal for the terminal default colour; or a hexadecimal RGB string such as ‘#ffffff’.

       bg=colour
               Set the background colour.

       us=colour
               Set the underscore colour.

       none    Set no attributes (turn off any active attributes).

       acs, bright (or bold), dim, underscore, blink, reverse, hidden, italics, overline, strikethrough, double-underscore, curly-underscore, dotted-underscore, dashed-underscore
               Set an attribute.  Any of the attributes may be prefixed with ‘no’ to unset.  acs is the terminal alternate character set.

       align=left (or noalign), align=centre, align=right
               Align text to the left, centre or right of the available space if appropriate.

       fill=colour
               Fill the available space with a background colour if appropriate.

       list=on, list=focus, list=left-marker, list=right-marker, nolist
               Mark the position of the various window list components in the status-format option: list=on marks the start of the list; list=focus is the part of the list that should be kept in focus if the en‐
               tire list won't fit in the available space (typically the current window); list=left-marker and list=right-marker mark the text to be used to mark that text has been trimmed from the left or right
               of the list if there is not enough space.

       push-default, pop-default
               Store  the current colours and attributes as the default or reset to the previous default.  A push-default affects any subsequent use of the default term until a pop-default.  Only one default may
               be pushed (each push-default replaces the previous saved default).

       range=left, range=right, range=session|X, range=window|X, range=pane|X, range=user|X, norange
               Mark a range for mouse events in the status-format option.  When a mouse event occurs in the range=left or range=right range, the ‘StatusLeft’ and ‘StatusRight’ key bindings are triggered.

               range=session|X, range=window|X and range=pane|X are ranges for a session, window or pane.  These trigger the ‘Status’ mouse key with the target session, window or pane given by the ‘X’  argument.
               ‘X’ is a session ID, window index in the current session or a pane ID.  For these, the mouse_status_range format variable will be set to ‘session’, ‘window’ or ‘pane’.

               range=user|X is a user-defined range; it triggers the ‘Status’ mouse key.  The argument ‘X’ will be available in the mouse_status_range format variable.  ‘X’ must be at most 15 bytes in length.

       Examples are:

             fg=yellow bold underscore blink
             bg=black,fg=default,noreverse
