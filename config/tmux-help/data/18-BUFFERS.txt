BUFFERS
       tmux maintains a set of named paste buffers.  Each buffer may be either explicitly or automatically named.  Explicitly named buffers are named when created with the set-buffer or load-buffer commands,  or
       by renaming an automatically named buffer with set-buffer -n.  Automatically named buffers are given a name such as ‘buffer0001’, ‘buffer0002’ and so on.  When the buffer-limit option is reached, the old‐
       est automatically named buffer is deleted.  Explicitly named buffers are not subject to buffer-limit and may be deleted with the delete-buffer command.

       Buffers  may be added using copy-mode or the set-buffer and load-buffer commands, and pasted into a window using the paste-buffer command.  If a buffer command is used and no buffer is specified, the most
       recently added automatically named buffer is assumed.

       A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.  By default, up to 2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the history-limit option (see the set-option command above).

       The buffer commands are as follows:

       choose-buffer [-NZr] [-F format] [-f filter] [-K key-format] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane] [template]
               Put a pane into buffer mode, where a buffer may be chosen interactively from a list.  Each buffer is shown on one line.  A shortcut key is shown on the left  in  brackets  allowing  for  immediate
               choice, or the list may be navigated and an item chosen or otherwise manipulated using the keys below.  -Z zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in buffer mode:

                     Key    Function
                     Enter  Paste selected buffer
                     Up     Select previous buffer
                     Down   Select next buffer
                     C-s    Search by name or content
                     n      Repeat last search
                     t      Toggle if buffer is tagged
                     T      Tag no buffers
                     C-t    Tag all buffers
                     p      Paste selected buffer
                     P      Paste tagged buffers
                     d      Delete selected buffer
                     D      Delete tagged buffers
                     e      Open the buffer in an editor
                     f      Enter a format to filter items
                     O      Change sort field
                     r      Reverse sort order
                     v      Toggle preview
                     q      Exit mode

               After a buffer is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the buffer name in template and the result executed as a command.  If template is not given, "paste-buffer -b '%%'" is used.

               -O specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘time’ (creation), ‘name’ or ‘size’.  -r reverses the sort order.  -f specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to zero, the
               item  in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the format for each item in the list and -K a format for each shortcut
               key; both are evaluated once for each line.  -N starts without the preview.  This command works only if at least one client is attached.

       clear-history [-H] [-t target-pane]
                     (alias: clearhist)
               Remove and free the history for the specified pane.  -H also removes all hyperlinks.

       delete-buffer [-b buffer-name]
                     (alias: deleteb)
               Delete the buffer named buffer-name, or the most recently added automatically named buffer if not specified.

       list-buffers [-F format] [-f filter]
                     (alias: lsb)
               List the global buffers.  -F specifies the format of each line and -f a filter.  Only buffers for which the filter is true are shown.  See the “FORMATS” section.

       load-buffer [-w] [-b buffer-name] [-t target-client] path
                     (alias: loadb)
               Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from path.  If -w is given, the buffer is also sent to the clipboard for target-client using the xterm(1) escape sequence, if possible.

       paste-buffer [-dpr] [-b buffer-name] [-s separator] [-t target-pane]
                     (alias: pasteb)
               Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane.  If not specified, paste into the current one.  With -d, also delete the paste buffer.  When output, any linefeed (LF) characters  in
               the  paste  buffer  are replaced with a separator, by default carriage return (CR).  A custom separator may be specified using the -s flag.  The -r flag means to do no replacement (equivalent to a
               separator of LF).  If -p is specified, paste bracket control codes are inserted around the buffer if the application has requested bracketed paste mode.

       save-buffer [-a] [-b buffer-name] path
                     (alias: saveb)
               Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to path.  The -a option appends to rather than overwriting the file.

       set-buffer [-aw] [-b buffer-name] [-t target-client] [-n new-buffer-name] data
                     (alias: setb)
               Set the contents of the specified buffer to data.  If -w is given, the buffer is also sent to the clipboard for target-client using the xterm(1) escape sequence, if possible.  The  -a  option  ap‐
               pends to rather than overwriting the buffer.  The -n option renames the buffer to new-buffer-name.

       show-buffer [-b buffer-name]
                     (alias: showb)
               Display the contents of the specified buffer.
