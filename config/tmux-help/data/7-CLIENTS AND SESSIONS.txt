CLIENTS AND SESSIONS
       The tmux server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.  Clients are attached to sessions to interact with them, either when they are  created  with  the  new-session  command,  or  later  with  the
       attach-session  command.   Each  session has one or more windows linked into it.  Windows may be linked to multiple sessions and are made up of one or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo terminal.
       Commands for creating, linking and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in the “WINDOWS AND PANES” section.

       The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:

       attach-session [-dErx] [-c working-directory] [-f flags] [-t target-session]
                     (alias: attach)
               If run from outside tmux, create a new client in the current terminal and attach it to target-session.  If used from inside, switch the current client.  If -d is specified, any other  clients  at‐
               tached  to the session are detached.  If -x is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of the client as well as detaching the client, typically causing it to exit.  -f sets a comma-separated list
               of client flags.  The flags are:

               active-pane
                       the client has an independent active pane

               ignore-size
                       the client does not affect the size of other clients

               no-output
                       the client does not receive pane output in control mode

               pause-after=seconds
                       output is paused once the pane is seconds behind in control mode

               read-only
                       the client is read-only

               wait-exit
                       wait for an empty line input before exiting in control mode

               A leading ‘!’ turns a flag off if the client is already attached.  -r is an alias for -f read-only,ignore-size.  When a client is read-only, only keys bound to the detach-client  or  switch-client
               commands  have  any effect.  A client with the active-pane flag allows the active pane to be selected independently of the window's active pane used by clients without the flag.  This only affects
               the cursor position and commands issued from the client; other features such as hooks and styles continue to use the window's active pane.

               If no server is started, attach-session will attempt to start it; this will fail unless sessions are created in the configuration file.

               The target-session rules for attach-session are slightly adjusted: if tmux needs to select the most recently used session, it will prefer the most recently used unattached session.

               -c will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to working-directory.

               If -E is used, the update-environment option will not be applied.

       detach-client [-aP] [-E shell-command] [-s target-session] [-t target-client]
                     (alias: detach)
               Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified with -t, or all clients currently attached to the session specified by -s.  The -a option kills all but the client given with  -t.
               If -P is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of the client, typically causing it to exit.  With -E, run shell-command to replace the client.

       has-session [-t target-session]
                     (alias: has)
               Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist.  If it does exist, exit with 0.

       kill-server
               Kill the tmux server and clients and destroy all sessions.

       kill-session [-aC] [-t target-session]
               Destroy  the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other sessions, and detaching all clients attached to it.  If -a is given, all sessions but the specified one is killed.  The -C
               flag clears alerts (bell, activity, or silence) in all windows linked to the session.

       list-clients [-F format] [-f filter] [-t target-session]
                     (alias: lsc)
               List all clients attached to the server.  -F specifies the format of each line and -f a filter.  Only clients for which the filter is true are shown.  See the “FORMATS” section.  If target-session
               is specified, list only clients connected to that session.

       list-commands [-F format] [command]
                     (alias: lscm)
               List the syntax of command or - if omitted - of all commands supported by tmux.

       list-sessions [-F format] [-f filter]
                     (alias: ls)
               List all sessions managed by the server.  -F specifies the format of each line and -f a filter.  Only sessions for which the filter is true are shown.  See the “FORMATS” section.

       lock-client [-t target-client]
                     (alias: lockc)
               Lock target-client, see the lock-server command.

       lock-session [-t target-session]
                     (alias: locks)
               Lock all clients attached to target-session.

       new-session [-AdDEPX] [-c start-directory] [-e environment] [-f flags] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s session-name] [-t group-name] [-x width] [-y height] [shell-command]
                     (alias: new)
               Create a new session with name session-name.

               The new session is attached to the current terminal unless -d is given.  window-name and shell-command are the name of and shell command to execute in the initial window.   With  -d,  the  initial
               size  comes  from the global default-size option; -x and -y can be used to specify a different size.  ‘-’ uses the size of the current client if any.  If -x or -y is given, the default-size option
               is set for the session.  -f sets a comma-separated list of client flags (see attach-session).

               If run from a terminal, any termios(4) special characters are saved and used for new windows in the new session.

               The -A flag makes new-session behave like attach-session if session-name already exists; if -A is given, -D behaves like -d to attach-session, and -X behaves like -x to attach-session.

               If -t is given, it specifies a session group.  Sessions in the same group share the same set of windows - new windows are linked to all sessions in the group and any windows  closed  removed  from
               all sessions.  The current and previous window and any session options remain independent and any session in a group may be killed without affecting the others.  The group-name argument may be:

               1.      the name of an existing group, in which case the new session is added to that group;

               2.      the name of an existing session - the new session is added to the same group as that session, creating a new group if necessary;

               3.      the name for a new group containing only the new session.

               -n and shell-command are invalid if -t is used.

               The -P option prints information about the new session after it has been created.  By default, it uses the format ‘#{session_name}:’ but a different format may be specified with -F.

               If  -E  is used, the update-environment option will not be applied.  -e takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an environment variable for the newly created session; it may be specified multiple
               times.

       refresh-client [-cDLRSU] [-A pane:state] [-B name:what:format] [-C size] [-f flags] [-l [target-pane]] [-t target-client] [adjustment]
                     (alias: refresh)
               Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is given with -t.  If -S is specified, only update the client's status line.

               The -U, -D, -L -R, and -c flags allow the visible portion of a window which is larger than the client to be changed.  -U moves the visible part up by adjustment  rows  and  -D  down,  -L  left  by
               adjustment columns and -R right.  -c returns to tracking the cursor automatically.  If adjustment is omitted, 1 is used.  Note that the visible position is a property of the client not of the win‐
               dow, changing the current window in the attached session will reset it.

               -C  sets  the width and height of a control mode client or of a window for a control mode client, size must be one of ‘widthxheight’ or ‘window ID:widthxheight’, for example ‘80x24’ or ‘@0:80x24’.
               -A allows a control mode client to trigger actions on a pane.  The argument is a pane ID (with leading ‘%’), a colon, then one of ‘on’, ‘off’, ‘continue’ or ‘pause’.  If ‘off’, tmux will not  send
               output  from  the  pane  to the client and if all clients have turned the pane off, will stop reading from the pane.  If ‘continue’, tmux will return to sending output to the pane if it was paused
               (manually or with the pause-after flag).  If ‘pause’, tmux will pause the pane.  -A may be given multiple times for different panes.

               -B sets a subscription to a format for a control mode client.  The argument is split into three items by colons: name is a name for the subscription; what is a type of item to subscribe to; format
               is the format.  After a subscription is added, changes to the format are reported with the %subscription-changed notification, at most once a second.  If only the name is given,  the  subscription
               is  removed.   what may be empty to check the format only for the attached session, or one of: a pane ID such as ‘%0’; ‘%*’ for all panes in the attached session; a window ID such as ‘@0’; or ‘@*’
               for all windows in the attached session.

               -f sets a comma-separated list of client flags, see attach-session.

               -l requests the clipboard from the client using the xterm(1) escape sequence.  If target-pane is given, the clipboard is sent (in encoded form), otherwise it is stored in a new paste buffer.

               -L, -R, -U and -D move the visible portion of the window left, right, up or down by adjustment, if the window is larger than the client.  -c resets so that the position follows  the  cursor.   See
               the window-size option.

       rename-session [-t target-session] new-name
                     (alias: rename)
               Rename the session to new-name.

       server-access [-adlrw] [user]
               Change the access or read/write permission of user.  The user running the tmux server (its owner) and the root user cannot be changed and are always permitted access.

               -a and -d are used to give or revoke access for the specified user.  If the user is already attached, the -d flag causes their clients to be detached.

               -r and -w change the permissions for user: -r makes their clients read-only and -w writable.  -l lists current access permissions.

               By  default,  the access list is empty and tmux creates sockets with file system permissions preventing access by any user other than the owner (and root).  These permissions must be changed manu‐
               ally.  Great care should be taken not to allow access to untrusted users even read-only.

       show-messages [-JT] [-t target-client]
                     (alias: showmsgs)
               Show server messages or information.  Messages are stored, up to a maximum of the limit set by the message-limit server option.  -J and -T show debugging information about jobs and terminals.

       source-file [-Fnqv] [-t target-pane] path ...
                     (alias: source)
               Execute commands from one or more files specified by path (which may be glob(7) patterns).  If -F is present, then path is expanded as a format.  If -q is given, no error will be returned if  path
               does not exist.  With -n, the file is parsed but no commands are executed.  -v shows the parsed commands and line numbers if possible.

       start-server
                     (alias: start)
               Start the tmux server, if not already running, without creating any sessions.

               Note  that as by default the tmux server will exit with no sessions, this is only useful if a session is created in ~/.tmux.conf, exit-empty is turned off, or another command is run as part of the
               same command sequence.  For example:

                     $ tmux start \; show -g

       suspend-client [-t target-client]
                     (alias: suspendc)
               Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).

       switch-client [-ElnprZ] [-c target-client] [-t target-session] [-T key-table]
                     (alias: switchc)
               Switch the current session for client target-client to target-session.  As a special case, -t may refer to a pane (a target that contains ‘:’, ‘.’ or ‘%’), to change session, window and pane.   In
               that  case,  -Z  keeps  the  window  zoomed if it was zoomed.  If -l, -n or -p is used, the client is moved to the last, next or previous session respectively.  -r toggles the client read-only and
               ignore-size flags (see the attach-session command).

               If -E is used, update-environment option will not be applied.

               -T sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will be interpreted from key-table.  This may be used to configure multiple prefix keys, or to bind commands to sequences of keys.  For
               example, to make typing ‘abc’ run the list-keys command:

                     bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
                     bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
                     bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1
