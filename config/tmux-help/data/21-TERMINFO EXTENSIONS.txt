TERMINFO EXTENSIONS
       tmux understands some unofficial extensions to terminfo(5).  It is not normally necessary to set these manually, instead the terminal-features option should be used.

       AX      An existing extension that tells tmux the terminal supports default colours.

       Bidi    Tell tmux that the terminal supports the VTE bidirectional text extensions.

       Cs, Cr  Set  the  cursor  colour.  The first takes a single string argument and is used to set the colour; the second takes no arguments and restores the default cursor colour.  If set, a sequence such as
               this may be used to change the cursor colour from inside tmux:

                     $ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'

               The colour is an X(7) colour, see XParseColor(3).

       Cmg, Clmg, Dsmg, Enmg
               Set, clear, disable or enable DECSLRM margins.  These are set automatically if the terminal reports it is VT420 compatible.

       Dsbp, Enbp
               Disable and enable bracketed paste.  These are set automatically if the XT capability is present.

       Dseks, Eneks
               Disable and enable extended keys.

       Dsfcs, Enfcs
               Disable and enable focus reporting.  These are set automatically if the XT capability is present.

       Hls     Set or clear a hyperlink annotation.

       Nobr    Tell tmux that the terminal does not use bright colors for bold display.

       Rect    Tell tmux that the terminal supports rectangle operations.

       Smol    Enable the overline attribute.

       Smulx   Set a styled underscore.  The single parameter is one of: 0 for no underscore, 1 for normal underscore, 2 for double underscore, 3 for curly underscore, 4 for dotted underscore and  5  for  dashed
               underscore.

       Setulc, Setulc1, ol
               Set  the  underscore  colour or reset to the default.  Setulc is for RGB colours and Setulc1 for ANSI or 256 colours.  The Setulc argument is (red * 65536) + (green * 256) + blue where each is be‐
               tween 0 and 255.

       Ss, Se  Set or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the cursor to an underline:

                     $ printf '\033[4 q'

               If Se is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style instead.

       Swd     Set the opening sequence for the working directory notification.  The sequence is terminated using the standard fsl capability.

       Sxl     Indicates that the terminal supports SIXEL.

       Sync    Start (parameter is 1) or end (parameter is 2) a synchronized update.

       Tc      Indicate that the terminal supports the ‘direct colour’ RGB escape sequence (for example, \e[38;2;255;255;255m).

               If supported, this is used for the initialize colour escape sequence (which may be enabled by adding the ‘initc’ and ‘ccc’ capabilities to the tmux terminfo(5) entry).

               This is equivalent to the RGB terminfo(5) capability.

       Ms      Store the current buffer in the host terminal's selection (clipboard).  See the set-clipboard option above and the xterm(1) man page.

       XT      This is an existing extension capability that tmux uses to mean that the terminal supports the xterm(1) title set sequences and to automatically set some of the capabilities above.
