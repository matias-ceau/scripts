HOOKS
       tmux allows commands to run on various triggers, called hooks.  Most tmux commands have an after hook and there are a number of hooks not associated with commands.

       Hooks  are stored as array options, members of the array are executed in order when the hook is triggered.  Like options different hooks may be global or belong to a session, window or pane.  Hooks may be
       configured with the set-hook or set-option commands and displayed with show-hooks or show-options -H.  The following two commands are equivalent:

              set-hook -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'
              set-option -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'

       Setting a hook without specifying an array index clears the hook and sets the first member of the array.

       A command's after hook is run after it completes, except when the command is run as part of a hook itself.  They are named with an ‘after-’ prefix.  For example, the following command adds a hook  to  se‐
       lect the even-vertical layout after every split-window:

             set-hook -g after-split-window "selectl even-vertical"

       All the notifications listed in the “CONTROL MODE” section are hooks (without any arguments), except %exit.  The following additional hooks are available:

       alert-activity          Run when a window has activity.  See monitor-activity.

       alert-bell              Run when a window has received a bell.  See monitor-bell.

       alert-silence           Run when a window has been silent.  See monitor-silence.

       client-active           Run when a client becomes the latest active client of its session.

       client-attached         Run when a client is attached.

       client-detached         Run when a client is detached

       client-focus-in         Run when focus enters a client

       client-focus-out        Run when focus exits a client

       client-resized          Run when a client is resized.

       client-session-changed  Run when a client's attached session is changed.

       pane-died               Run when the program running in a pane exits, but remain-on-exit is on so the pane has not closed.

       pane-exited             Run when the program running in a pane exits.

       pane-focus-in           Run when the focus enters a pane, if the focus-events option is on.

       pane-focus-out          Run when the focus exits a pane, if the focus-events option is on.

       pane-set-clipboard      Run when the terminal clipboard is set using the xterm(1) escape sequence.

       session-created         Run when a new session created.

       session-closed          Run when a session closed.

       session-renamed         Run when a session is renamed.

       window-linked           Run when a window is linked into a session.

       window-renamed          Run when a window is renamed.

       window-resized          Run when a window is resized.  This may be after the client-resized hook is run.

       window-unlinked         Run when a window is unlinked from a session.

       Hooks are managed with these commands:

       set-hook [-agpRuw] [-t target-pane] hook-name command
               Without -R, sets (or with -u unsets) hook hook-name to command.  The flags are the same as for set-option.

               With -R, run hook-name immediately.

       show-hooks [-gpw] [-t target-pane]
               Shows hooks.  The flags are the same as for show-options.
