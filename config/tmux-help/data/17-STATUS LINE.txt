STATUS LINE
       tmux includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each terminal.

       By default, the status line is enabled and one line in height (it may be disabled or made multiple lines with the status session option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name of the  current  session
       in square brackets; the window list; the title of the active pane in double quotes; and the time and date.

       Each  line  of the status line is configured with the status-format option.  The default is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections (which may contain dynamic content such as the time or
       output from a shell command, see the status-left, status-left-length, status-right, and status-right-length options below), and a central window list.  By default, the window list shows  the  index,  name
       and (if any) flag of the windows present in the current session in ascending numerical order.  It may be customised with the window-status-format and window-status-current-format options.  The flag is one
       of the following symbols appended to the window name:

             Symbol    Meaning
             *         Denotes the current window.
             -         Marks the last window (previously selected).
             #         Window activity is monitored and activity has been detected.
             !         Window bells are monitored and a bell has occurred in the window.
             ~         The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval.
             M         The window contains the marked pane.
             Z         The window's active pane is zoomed.

       The # symbol relates to the monitor-activity window option.  The window name is printed in inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or silence) is present.

       The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the entire status line using the status-style session option and individual windows using the window-status-style window option.

       The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the interval may be controlled with the status-interval session option.

       Commands related to the status line are as follows:

       clear-prompt-history [-T prompt-type]
                     (alias: clearphist)
               Clear status prompt history for prompt type prompt-type.  If -T is omitted, then clear history for all types.  See command-prompt for possible values for prompt-type.

       command-prompt [-1bFikN] [-I inputs] [-p prompts] [-t target-client] [-T prompt-type] [template]
               Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used from inside tmux to execute commands interactively.

               If template is specified, it is used as the command.  With -F, template is expanded as a format.

               If  present, -I is a comma-separated list of the initial text for each prompt.  If -p is given, prompts is a comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in order; otherwise a single prompt
               is displayed, constructed from template if it is present, or ‘:’ if not.

               Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the string ‘%%’ and all occurrences of ‘%1’ are replaced by the response to the first prompt, all ‘%2’ are replaced with the response to the
               second prompt, and so on for further prompts.  Up to nine prompt responses may be replaced (‘%1’ to ‘%9’).  ‘%%%’ is like ‘%%’ but any quotation marks are escaped.

               -1 makes the prompt only accept one key press, in this case the resulting input is a single character.  -k is like -1 but the key press is translated to a key name.  -N makes the prompt  only  ac‐
               cept numeric key presses.  -i executes the command every time the prompt input changes instead of when the user exits the command prompt.

               -T tells tmux the prompt type.  This affects what completions are offered when Tab is pressed.  Available types are: ‘command’, ‘search’, ‘target’ and ‘window-target’.

               The following keys have a special meaning in the command prompt, depending on the value of the status-keys option:

                     Function                             vi        emacs
                     Cancel command prompt                q         Escape
                     Delete from cursor to start of word            C-w
                     Delete entire command                d         C-u
                     Delete from cursor to end            D         C-k
                     Execute command                      Enter     Enter
                     Get next command from history                  Down
                     Get previous command from history              Up
                     Insert top paste buffer              p         C-y
                     Look for completions                 Tab       Tab
                     Move cursor left                     h         Left
                     Move cursor right                    l         Right
                     Move cursor to end                   $         C-e
                     Move cursor to next word             w         M-f
                     Move cursor to previous word         b         M-b
                     Move cursor to start                 0         C-a
                     Transpose characters                           C-t

               With -b, the prompt is shown in the background and the invoking client does not exit until it is dismissed.

       confirm-before [-by] [-c confirm-key] [-p prompt] [-t target-client] command
                     (alias: confirm)
               Ask  for  confirmation  before  executing command.  If -p is given, prompt is the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt is constructed from command.  It may contain the special character sequences
               supported by the status-left option.  With -b, the prompt is shown in the background and the invoking client does not exit until it is dismissed.  -y changes the default behaviour (if Enter  alone
               is pressed) of the prompt to run the command.  -c changes the confirmation key to confirm-key; the default is ‘y’.

       display-menu  [-O]  [-b  border-lines]  [-c  target-client]  [-C  starting-choice] [-H selected-style] [-s style] [-S border-style] [-t target-pane] [-T title] [-x position] [-y position] name key command
               [argument ...]
                     (alias: menu)
               Display a menu on target-client.  target-pane gives the target for any commands run from the menu.

               A menu is passed as a series of arguments: first the menu item name, second the key shortcut (or empty for none) and third the command to run when the menu item is chosen.  The  name  and  command
               are  formats,  see  the  “FORMATS” and “STYLES” sections.  If the name begins with a hyphen (-), then the item is disabled (shown dim) and may not be chosen.  The name may be empty for a separator
               line, in which case both the key and command should be omitted.

               -b sets the type of characters used for drawing menu borders.  See popup-border-lines for possible values for border-lines.

               -H sets the style for the selected menu item (see “STYLES”).

               -s sets the style for the menu and -S sets the style for the menu border (see “STYLES”).

               -T is a format for the menu title (see “FORMATS”).

               -C sets the menu item selected by default, if the menu is not bound to a mouse key binding.

               -x and -y give the position of the menu.  Both may be a row or column number, or one of the following special values:

                     Value    Flag    Meaning
                     C        Both    The centre of the terminal
                     R        -x      The right side of the terminal
                     P        Both    The bottom left of the pane
                     M        Both    The mouse position
                     W        Both    The window position on the status line
                     S        -y      The line above or below the status line

               Or a format, which is expanded including the following additional variables:

                     Variable name                 Replaced with
                     popup_centre_x                Centered in the client
                     popup_centre_y                Centered in the client
                     popup_height                  Height of menu or popup
                     popup_mouse_bottom            Bottom of at the mouse
                     popup_mouse_centre_x          Horizontal centre at the mouse
                     popup_mouse_centre_y          Vertical centre at the mouse
                     popup_mouse_top               Top at the mouse
                     popup_mouse_x                 Mouse X position
                     popup_mouse_y                 Mouse Y position
                     popup_pane_bottom             Bottom of the pane
                     popup_pane_left               Left of the pane
                     popup_pane_right              Right of the pane
                     popup_pane_top                Top of the pane
                     popup_status_line_y           Above or below the status line
                     popup_width                   Width of menu or popup
                     popup_window_status_line_x    At the window position in status line
                     popup_window_status_line_y    At the status line showing the window

               Each menu consists of items followed by a key shortcut shown in brackets.  If the menu is too large to fit on the terminal, it is not displayed.  Pressing the key shortcut chooses the  correspond‐
               ing  item.   If  the  mouse is enabled and the menu is opened from a mouse key binding, releasing the mouse button with an item selected chooses that item and releasing the mouse button without an
               item selected closes the menu.  -O changes this behaviour so that the menu does not close when the mouse button is released without an item selected the menu is not closed and a mouse button  must
               be clicked to choose an item.

               The following keys are also available:

                     Key    Function
                     Enter  Choose selected item
                     Up     Select previous item
                     Down   Select next item
                     q      Exit menu

       display-message [-aIlNpv] [-c target-client] [-d delay] [-t target-pane] [message]
                     (alias: display)
               Display  a  message.   If  -p  is  given,  the  output  is  printed  to stdout, otherwise it is displayed in the target-client status line for up to delay milliseconds.  If delay is not given, the
               display-time option is used; a delay of zero waits for a key press.  ‘N’ ignores key presses and closes only after the delay expires.  If -l is given, message is printed unchanged.  Otherwise, the
               format of message is described in the “FORMATS” section; information is taken from target-pane if -t is given, otherwise the active pane.

               -v prints verbose logging as the format is parsed and -a lists the format variables and their values.

               -I forwards any input read from stdin to the empty pane given by target-pane.

       display-popup [-BCE] [-b border-lines] [-c target-client] [-d start-directory] [-e environment] [-h height] [-s border-style] [-S style] [-t target-pane] [-T title] [-w width] [-x position] [-y  position]
               [shell-command]
                     (alias: popup)
               Display a popup running shell-command on target-client.  A popup is a rectangular box drawn over the top of any panes.  Panes are not updated while a popup is present.

               -E closes the popup automatically when shell-command exits.  Two -E closes the popup only if shell-command exited with success.

               -x  and  -y give the position of the popup, they have the same meaning as for the display-menu command.  -w and -h give the width and height - both may be a percentage (followed by ‘%’).  If omit‐
               ted, half of the terminal size is used.

               -B does not surround the popup by a border.

               -b sets the type of characters used for drawing popup borders.  When -B is specified, the -b option is ignored.  See popup-border-lines for possible values for border-lines.

               -s sets the style for the popup and -S sets the style for the popup border (see “STYLES”).

               -e takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an environment variable for the popup; it may be specified multiple times.

               -T is a format for the popup title (see “FORMATS”).

               The -C flag closes any popup on the client.

       show-prompt-history [-T prompt-type]
                     (alias: showphist)
               Display status prompt history for prompt type prompt-type.  If -T is omitted, then show history for all types.  See command-prompt for possible values for prompt-type.
