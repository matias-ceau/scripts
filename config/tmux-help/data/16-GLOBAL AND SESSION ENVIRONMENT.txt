GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT
       When the server is started, tmux copies the environment into the global environment; in addition, each session has a session environment.  When a window is created, the session and global environments are
       merged.  If a variable exists in both, the value from the session environment is used.  The result is the initial environment passed to the new process.

       The update-environment session option may be used to update the session environment from the client when a new session is created or an old reattached.  tmux also initialises the TMUX variable  with  some
       internal information to allow commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM variable with the correct terminal setting of ‘screen’.

       Variables  in  both session and global environments may be marked as hidden.  Hidden variables are not passed into the environment of new processes and instead can only be used by tmux itself (for example
       in formats, see the “FORMATS” section).

       Commands to alter and view the environment are:

       set-environment [-Fhgru] [-t target-session] name [value]
                     (alias: setenv)
               Set or unset an environment variable.  If -g is used, the change is made in the global environment; otherwise, it is applied to the session environment for target-session.  If -F is present,  then
               value is expanded as a format.  The -u flag unsets a variable.  -r indicates the variable is to be removed from the environment before starting a new process.  -h marks the variable as hidden.

       show-environment [-hgs] [-t target-session] [variable]
                     (alias: showenv)
               Display  the  environment for target-session or the global environment with -g.  If variable is omitted, all variables are shown.  Variables removed from the environment are prefixed with ‘-’.  If
               -s is used, the output is formatted as a set of Bourne shell commands.  -h shows hidden variables (omitted by default).
