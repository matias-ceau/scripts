CONTROL MODE
       tmux offers a textual interface called control mode.  This allows applications to communicate with tmux using a simple text-only protocol.

       In control mode, a client sends tmux commands or command sequences terminated by newlines on standard input.  Each command will produce one block of output on standard output.  An output block consists of
       a %begin line followed by the output (which may be empty).  The output block ends with a %end or %error.  %begin and matching %end or %error have three arguments: an integer time (as seconds from  epoch),
       command number and flags (currently not used).  For example:

             %begin 1363006971 2 1
             0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
             %end 1363006971 2 1

       The refresh-client -C command may be used to set the size of a client in control mode.

       In control mode, tmux outputs notifications.  A notification will never occur inside an output block.

       The following notifications are defined:

       %client-detached client
               The client has detached.

       %client-session-changed client session-id name
               The client is now attached to the session with ID session-id, which is named name.

       %config-error error
               An error has happened in a configuration file.

       %continue pane-id
               The pane has been continued after being paused (if the pause-after flag is set, see refresh-client -A).

       %exit [reason]
               The tmux client is exiting immediately, either because it is not attached to any session or an error occurred.  If present, reason describes why the client exited.

       %extended-output pane-id age ... : value
               New  form  of %output sent when the pause-after flag is set.  age is the time in milliseconds for which tmux had buffered the output before it was sent.  Any subsequent arguments up until a single
               ‘:’ are for future use and should be ignored.

       %layout-change window-id window-layout window-visible-layout window-flags
               The layout of a window with ID window-id changed.  The new layout is window-layout.  The window's visible layout is window-visible-layout and the window flags are window-flags.

       %message message
               A message sent with the display-message command.

       %output pane-id value
               A window pane produced output.  value escapes non-printable characters and backslash as octal \xxx.

       %pane-mode-changed pane-id
               The pane with ID pane-id has changed mode.

       %paste-buffer-changed name
               Paste buffer name has been changed.

       %paste-buffer-deleted name
               Paste buffer name has been deleted.

       %pause pane-id
               The pane has been paused (if the pause-after flag is set).

       %session-changed session-id name
               The client is now attached to the session with ID session-id, which is named name.

       %session-renamed name
               The current session was renamed to name.

       %session-window-changed session-id window-id
               The session with ID session-id changed its active window to the window with ID window-id.

       %sessions-changed
               A session was created or destroyed.

       %subscription-changed name session-id window-id window-index pane-id ... : value
               The value of the format associated with subscription name has changed to value.  See refresh-client -B.  Any arguments after pane-id up until a single ‘:’ are for future use and should be ignored.

       %unlinked-window-add window-id
               The window with ID window-id was created but is not linked to the current session.

       %unlinked-window-close window-id
               The window with ID window-id, which is not linked to the current session, was closed.

       %unlinked-window-renamed window-id
               The window with ID window-id, which is not linked to the current session, was renamed.

       %window-add window-id
               The window with ID window-id was linked to the current session.

       %window-close window-id
               The window with ID window-id closed.

       %window-pane-changed window-id pane-id
               The active pane in the window with ID window-id changed to the pane with ID pane-id.

       %window-renamed window-id name
               The window with ID window-id was renamed to name.
