This repository hosts a collection of utility scripts and tools designed to enhance the user experience on Arch Linux, specifically tailored for those using the Qtile window manager. The scripts present a robust set of functionalities, with each meticulously crafted to cater to various needs like file management, media playback, environment setup, and more.

The repository includes scripts such as **[fix-markdown-links.sh](docs/scripts/fix-markdown-links.md)**, which modifies Markdown files to ensure that links are accurately referenced based on a specified base directory, helping users maintain proper documentation standards. **[llm-script-describer.py](docs/scripts/llm-script-describer.md)** automates the generation of GitHub documentation for user scripts, utilizing the capabilities of OpenAI's API for descriptive text creation, thus streamlining the documentation process.

Media handling is further advanced by scripts like **[m3u_creator.sh](docs/scripts/m3u_creator.md)**, which automatically generates playlist files for audio content in specified directories, and **[fzf_albumlauncher.xsh](docs/scripts/fzf_albumlauncher.md)**, which allows users to pick and play music albums interactively through a fuzzy finder interface.

To aid in productivity, tools like **[nvim_in_new_terminal.sh](docs/scripts/nvim_in_new_terminal.md)** enable users to open files efficiently in Neovim within a floating terminal, maintaining workflows without disruption. The **[command_prompt.sh](docs/scripts/command_prompt.md)** script leverages shell history for improved command input efficiency, providing a friendlier interface for command execution.

The repository holds additional convenience scripts such as **[random_wallpapers.xsh](docs/scripts/random_wallpapers.md)**, which picks wallpapers randomly for a more dynamic aesthetic environment, and **[sync-repo.sh](docs/scripts/sync-repo.md)**, which manages Git repository synchronization effortlessly.

In summary, this repository is not merely a collection but a comprehensive toolkit aimed at enhancing the user experience on Arch Linux systems utilizing Qtile. Each script is designed to provide utility, streamline workflows, and bolster productivity, making it an essential asset for both casual users and power users alike. The integration of command-line tools with user-friendly interfaces ensures that users can efficiently perform tasks while maintaining a focus on simplicity and elegance in execution.
