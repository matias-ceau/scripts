# Scripts

## Description

<!-- llm_generated_output_start -->

This repository contains a rich collection of scripts designed to enhance the user experience on Arch Linux, specifically optimized for use with the Qtile window manager. These scripts cover a wide range of functionalities, catering to audio management, multimedia handling, file manipulation, and environment configuration. 

### General Overview

- **Audio Management**: Several scripts including [albumplayer.xsh](docs/scripts/albumplayer.xsh.md), [fzf_albumlauncher.xsh](docs/scripts/fzf_albumlauncher.xsh.md), and [launch_tmux_with_music_player.sh](docs/scripts/launch_tmux_with_music_player.sh) focus on facilitating music playback via console applications like `cmus`. Users can easily select albums or songs, randomize playlists, and handle audio settings in a streamlined manner.

- **File and Script Handling**: The repository features numerous utility scripts such as [select_script](docs/scripts/select_script.c.md) and [zipper.sh](docs/scripts/zipper.sh.md), that allow users to efficiently select and run scripts or create new ones. The script [new_script_creator.sh](docs/scripts/new_script_creator.sh.md) sets up new scripts with ease while integrating into the system’s path.

- **Personal Knowledge Management**: Scripts like [obsidian.xsh](docs/scripts/obsidian.xsh.md) help users manage their knowledge databases within the Obsidian tool, providing quick access to vaults, while [vimwiki.sh](docs/scripts/vimwiki.sh.md) facilitates easy note management with Vim.

- **Wallpaper and Display Management**: The [wallpaper.sh](docs/scripts/wallpaper.sh.md) and [random_wallpapers.xsh](docs/scripts/random_wallpapers.xsh.md) scripts simplify the process of managing and changing wallpapers from a specified directory. Users can set random wallpapers with ease or select from a list interactively.

- **Quote Document Management**: The [citeboard.sh](docs/scripts/citeboard.sh.md) script serves as a tool for managing paper citations, allowing seamless access to BibTeX files for users engaged in academic work.

- **Documentation Generation**: Scripts like [chatgpt-all-scripts-describer.py](docs/scripts/chatgpt-all-scripts-describer.py.md) and [llm-script-describer.py](docs/scripts/llm-script-describer.py.md) utilize AI to generate and maintain script documentation automatically, ensuring that all scripts are well-documented.

### Features & Usage

Here's a brief overview of key functionalities:

- **Interactive Selection**: Scripts often leverage `dmenu` or `fzf` for interactive menus that enhance selection processes, whether for audio files, notes, or scripts.

- **Versatile File Management**: Several scripts can create playlists or manipulate files, such as [m3u_creator.sh](docs/scripts/m3u_creator.sh.md), which generates playlists dynamically from the current directory.

- **Efficient Personalization**: Users can personalize their environment with scripts dedicated to launching and managing tasks efficiently (like `toggle_picom.sh` for managing compositing).

### Setup and Requirements

Before using the scripts, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed according to each script's requirements, which often include common tools like `bash`, `fzf`, `cmus`, and language-specific libraries like `pandas` for Python scripts. Most of the scripts can be made executable and run directly from the terminal, and users are encouraged to configure keybindings in Qtile for quick access.

This repository is targeted towards users who seek efficient ways to manage multimedia, documents, and scripts on their Arch Linux systems while using Qtile, with an emphasis on interactivity and ease of customization.
