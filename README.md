# Scripts

## Description

<!-- llm_generated_output_start -->

The repository contains a diverse collection of scripts primarily designed for enhancing productivity and managing various aspects of your workflow, especially tailored for **Arch Linux** and the **Qtile** window manager. These scripts take advantage of various command-line tools and libraries to provide users with efficient solutions for everyday tasks.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the functionalities included in these scripts:

- **File Management and Selection**: Scripts like `[fzf-file-manager.sh](docs/scripts/fzf-file-manager.md)`, and `[fzf_albumlauncher.xsh](docs/scripts/fzf_albumlauncher.xsh.md)` use **fzf**, a powerful command-line fuzzy finder, to enable quick and intuitive navigation through files and albums. These scripts also employ **eza**, a file listing tool, to present data in a user-friendly manner, offering previews with tools like **bat**.

- **Personal Knowledge Management**: Scripts like `[obsidian-vault-selector.sh](docs/scripts/obsidian-vault-selector.md)` and `[obsidian.xsh](docs/scripts/obsidian.xsh.md)` focus on managing personal knowledge bases with Obsidian, allowing users to open vaults and notes easily and interactively.

- **Music Management**: Various audio-related scripts such as `[albumplayer.xsh](docs/scripts/albumplayer.xsh.md)`, and `[mechen_music_transfert.py](docs/scripts/mechen_music_transfert.py.md)` help organize and play music collections. These scripts perform functions ranging from selecting and playing albums through **cmus** to transferring unlistened music albums to portable media players.

- **Window Management**: The scripts provide utilities for managing windows and groups within the Qtile environment, like `[qtile_window_to_group_and_switch.py](docs/scripts/qtile_window_to_group_and_switch.py.md)`, which allows toggling between different groups in the window manager.

- **Documentation and Script Management**: There are mechanisms to automate and manage documents and scripts within the repository. For instance, `[llm-script-describer.py](docs/scripts/llm-script-describer.py.md)` utilizes AI to generate GitHub markdown documentation from user scripts, fostering better maintainability and usability of the codebase.

- **Task Automation and Configuration**: The repository includes scripts for creating symlinks ([utils_update_symlinks.sh](docs/scripts/utils_update_symlinks.sh.md)), installing dependencies ([install_dependencies.sh](docs/scripts/install_dependencies.sh.md)), and synchronizing configurations with **chezmoi**.

- **Visual Feedback and Help**: Some scripts offer visual interfaces for selecting options, using **dmenu** and **rofi** alongside **fzf** for intuitive user interactions. Scripts like `[help-pastel.sh](docs/scripts/help-pastel.sh.md)` and `[keyboard-help.sh](docs/scripts/keyboard-help.sh.md)` serve to enhance user experience with real-time information and assistance.

This repository effectively brings together a pragmatic assortment of scripts that cater to various needs, enhancing your productivity and experience while leveraging the capabilities of Arch Linux and Qtile. Each script is well-documented within the repository, providing clear guidance on usage and customizable features.
