# Scripts

## Description

<!-- llm_generated_output_start -->

The repository contains a diverse collection of shell and Python scripts, tailored for enhancing workflows on an Arch Linux system with the Qtile window manager. These scripts serve various purposes, from managing audio files and Git repositories to document generation and providing user-friendly interfaces for executing commands efficiently.

### Key Features of the Scripts

- **File and Audio Management**: Several scripts, such as [playlist_player.xsh](docs/scripts/playlist_player.xsh.md) and [fzf_albumlauncher.xsh](docs/scripts/fzf_albumlauncher.xsh.md), allow users to select and play music playlists using `cmus`, leveraging `fzf` for quick selection and user interaction. Moreover, scripts like [m3u_creator.sh](docs/scripts/m3u_creator.sh.md) help create playlist files effortlessly.

- **Documentation Automation**: The repository includes tools like [llm-script-describer.py](docs/scripts/llm-script-describer.py.md) and [chatgpt-all-scripts-describer.py](docs/scripts/chatgpt-all-scripts-describer.py.md) that leverage AI models to generate markdown documentation for scripts. This assists maintainers in keeping documentation current and informative without manual overhead.

- **Markdown and Text Manipulation**: There are utility scripts like [fix-markdown-links.sh](docs/scripts/fix-markdown-links.sh.md) designed to standardize markdown links across files and [json_to_markdown.py](docs/scripts/json_to_markdown.py.md) for converting JSON files into a markdown format, simplifying the management of documentation formats.

- **Interactive Selection and Execution**: Scripts like [fzfmenu_run.sh](docs/scripts/fzfmenu_run.sh.md) and [select_script](docs/scripts/select_script.md) provide an interactive interface for selecting and executing scripts or commands, enhancing the user experience by streamlining access and execution through intuitive menus.

- **System Utilities**: Other scripts facilitate system tasks, including [get_repos_present_on_host.sh](docs/scripts/get_repos_present_on_host.sh.md) which scans for Git repositories and [toggle_picom.sh](docs/scripts/toggle_picom.sh.md) that toggles the picom compositor on and off, offering users control over their desktop environment.

- **Visual Aids**: For users needing visual context, scripts like [get_hyperlinks_in_folder.py](docs/scripts/get_hyperlinks_in_folder.py.md) generate graphs of hyperlinks in markdown files, and [rand_wallpapers.xsh](docs/scripts/rand_wallpapers.xsh.md) selects a random wallpaper, enhancing the aesthetic of the userâ€™s environment.

### Usage Integration

The scripts are designed to be run directly from the command line with necessary command-line arguments as specified in individual documentation. They can also be integrated into the Qtile window manager via custom keybindings for quick access, significantly boosting productivity through streamlined workflows. The flexibility of running these scripts makes them suitable for both interactive sessions and automated scripts through cron jobs or other scheduling mechanisms.

### Conclusion

Through this comprehensive suite of scripts, an Arch Linux user, particularly one using Qtile, can efficiently manage files, automate documentation, handle multimedia playback, and control system settings seamlessly. The collection encourages an organized and productive environment, allowing more focus on task execution rather than on managing the execution process itself.
