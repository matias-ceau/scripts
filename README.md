# Scripts

## Description

<!-- llm_generated_output_start -->

The repository contains a diverse set of scripts tailored for various utilities and tasks that can enhance your workflow on Arch Linux, particularly within the context of the Qtile window manager. Here's a consolidated view of the functionality provided by these scripts:

- **File and Markdown Management**: Scripts like [fix-markdown-links.sh](docs/scripts/fix-markdown-links.sh.md) allow you to manage and fix links in your markdown files easily, while [json_to_markdown.py](docs/scripts/json_to_markdown.py.md) helps convert JSON files into nicely formatted Markdown. The [m3u_creator.sh](docs/scripts/m3u_creator.sh.md) script automates the creation of m3u playlist files from audio files in a directory, streamlining the way you manage media.

- **Interactive Helpers**: Several scripts leverage tools like `fzf`, `rofi`, and `dmenu` to create interactive menus for selecting files or performing actions. For example, the [fzf-file-manager.sh](docs/scripts/fzf-file-manager.sh.md) offers a fuzzy finder for file management, while [fzf_songlauncher.sh](docs/scripts/fzf_songlauncher.sh.md) and [fzf_albumlauncher.xsh](docs/scripts/fzf_albumlauncher.xsh.md) simplify song and album selection for playback in the `cmus` music player.

- **Automated Documentation**: There are scripts such as [llm-script-describer.py](docs/scripts/llm-script-describer.py.md) that integrate external APIs to automatically generate documentation for your scripts, making maintenance easier and more organized.

- **System Configuration and Management**: The repository includes scripts like [update_env.xsh](docs/scripts/update_env.xsh.md) that handle environment variable management, and [get_repos_present_on_host.sh](docs/scripts/get_repos_present_on_host.sh.md) that lists local Git repositories. Additionally, scripts such as [install_dependencies.sh](docs/scripts/install_dependencies.sh.md) automate the installation of essential packages to prepare your system.

- **Media Operations**: Scripts dedicated to music management, like [playlist_player.xsh](docs/scripts/playlist_player.xsh.md) and [random_album.xsh](docs/scripts/random_album.xsh.md), allow for efficient music playback by selecting playlists or albums quickly.

- **Window Management**: There are several scripts aimed at managing windows in Qtile, like [qtile_dice_group.py](docs/scripts/qtile_dice_group.py.md), which allows for quick group switching based on a complementary numbering system.

- **Graphical Enhancements**: Scripts like [get-window-thumbnails.sh](docs/scripts/get-window-thumbnails.sh.md) assist in visually capturing and managing window thumbnails, enhancing the user's ability to navigate their workspace effectively.

This repository embodies a powerful toolkit for customization and convenience, particularly for users who leverage the flexibility of scripts in their daily computing environment on Arch Linux with the Qtile window manager. Each script emphasizes usability and functionality, aiming to automate common tasks, ease management, and enhance the interactive experience. While many of these scripts integrate user-friendly commands and interfaces, there's potential for enhanced error handling and feedback mechanisms within the scripts, contributing positively to the overall user experience.
