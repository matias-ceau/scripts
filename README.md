# Scripts

## Description

<!-- llm_generated_output_start -->

This repository contains a collection of various scripts aimed at enhancing productivity and managing files on an Arch Linux setup using the Qtile window manager. Each script is designed to cater to specific tasks, from music management to document handling, all while utilizing handy command-line tools and packages that align well with the Arch Linux philosophy.

Firstly, the **music scripts** offer utilities to manage and play audio files efficiently. For instance, scripts such as [launch_tmux_with_music_player.sh](docs/scripts/launch_tmux_with_music_player.sh) and [albumplayer.xsh](docs/scripts/albumplayer.xsh) allow users to launch music players like `cmus` in a `tmux` session or randomly select albums for playback. The **midi and music-transfer utilities**, such as [midi2arch.xsh](docs/scripts/midi2arch.xsh) and [sandisk_music_transfert.py](docs/scripts/sandisk_music_transfert.py), enable users to transform MIDI input into keyboard shortcuts and manage music file transfers efficiently, showcasing versatility in handling audio workflows.

The repository also features **document-related scripts** such as [vimwiki.sh](docs/scripts/vimwiki.sh) and [pdfopener.sh](docs/scripts/pdfopener.sh), which facilitate fast access and editing of text files and PDF documents. Moreover, tools like [create_cover_art.sh](docs/scripts/create_cover_art.sh) demonstrate how to derive visual elements from audio files, resulting in creative cover art generation derived from sound spectrograms.

Moreover, the repository contains **system management scripts**, including [utils_update_symlinks.sh](docs/scripts/utils_update_symlinks.sh), which helps maintain symbolic links for application scripts, and [toggle_picom.sh](docs/scripts/toggle_picom.sh), which efficiently manages compositing effects based on user needs. This is paired with scripts like [list_process.sh](docs/scripts/list_process.sh) to quickly check running services on the system.

In terms of customization and environment handling, scripts such as [update_env.xsh](docs/scripts/update_env.xsh) assist in managing configuration files and environmental variables. Additionally, [chezmoi_on_a_new_system.sh](docs/scripts/chezmoi_on_a_new_system.sh) provides an automated solution for setting up dotfiles across machines, emphasizing the repository’s focus on improving user experience through automation.

Furthermore, the repository integrates **fuzzy search capabilities** via scripts like [fzf_albumlauncher.xsh](docs/scripts/fzf_albumlauncher.xsh) and [fzfmenu_run.sh](docs/scripts/fzfmenu_run.sh), allowing users to seamlessly launch applications or select songs from a list of files, thus enhancing the interactivity of command-line operations.

Each script not only offers functional commands but also promotes efficient management of tasks while leveraging the flexibility of terminal operations. Overall, this collection serves as a valuable toolkit for users devoted to maintaining a streamlined and powerful Arch Linux environment alongside the Qtile window manager.
