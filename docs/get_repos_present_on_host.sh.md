# get_repos_present_on_host.sh

**Script Description**

This is a Bash script that generates a list of Git repositories found under a specified directory, sorts them uniquely, and appends the output to a master repository list file.

**Functionality Breakdown**

1. **Environment Variable Check**: The script first checks if two environment variables (`GIT_REPOS` and `LOCALDATA`) are set. If either variable is empty, it prints an error message and exits.
2. **Hostname Retrieval**: It retrieves the hostname of the system using the `hostname` command.
3. **Output File Path Definition**: Two output file paths are defined:
	* `$OUTPUT_FILE`: The path to a file containing a list of repositories found under the specified directory, filtered by the current hostname.
	* `$ALL_REPOS_FILE`: The path to a master file containing an aggregated list of all repositories found across multiple directories and hosts.
4. **Directory Creation**: If the output directory for `$OUTPUT_FILE` doesn't exist, it is created using `mkdir -p`.
5. **Repository Listing**:
	+ It uses `find` to search for directories with a `.git` subdirectory within the specified `$GIT_REPOS` path.
	+ The `sed` command removes the `$GIT_REPOS/` prefix and the `/\.git` suffix from each match, leaving only the repository name.
	+ The `awk` command filters out any lines with more than two fields (i.e., those without a hostname), and outputs to `$OUTPUT_FILE`.
6. **Sorting and Removing Duplicates**: The script uses `sort -u` to sort the output file uniquely.
7. **Master Repository List Update**: It appends the contents of `$OUTPUT_FILE` to `$ALL_REPOS_FILE`, then sorts and removes duplicates from the master list using `sort -u`.
8. **Success Message**: Finally, it prints a success message indicating that the repository list has been updated.

**Deployment Context**

This script is likely deployed in a CI/CD pipeline or as part of an automation workflow to maintain an up-to-date list of Git repositories across multiple hosts and directories. The `GIT_REPOS` environment variable would point to a directory containing the root of all Git repositories, while `LOCALDATA` might refer to a centralized storage location for output files.
