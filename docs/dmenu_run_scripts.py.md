# dmenu_run_scripts.py

**Script Overview**

This is a Python script that utilizes several command-line tools to create a dynamic menu system, similar to `dmenu_run`. The script:

1. Retrieves a list of choices from an external shell script (`script_identifier.xsh`).
2. Presents the choices to the user using `rofi`, a graphical frontend.
3. Executes the selected choice.

**Functionality Breakdown**

1. **Choice Retrieval**: The script uses `subprocess.run()` to execute `xonsh` with the input file `script_identifier.xsh`. The `-c` option specifies that the script should consider the entire command-line output as a single choice.
The resulting output is stored in the `choices` variable.

2. **Menu Generation**: The script then executes `rofi` with several options:
	* `-dmenu`: Enables dmenu-like behavior, where the input is taken from the `input` parameter (in this case, `choices`).
	* `-markup-rows`: Formats each menu item as a row.
	* `-i`: Ignores empty lines in the input.
	* `-lines 30`: Sets the maximum number of visible menu items to 30.
	* `-width 80`: Sets the width of the menu to 80 characters.
The resulting output is stored in the `rofi_output` variable.

3. **Choice Extraction**: The script extracts the selected choice by splitting the `rofi_output` string at the first occurrence of `>` and then taking the substring between `<`. The extracted choice is stored in the `choice` variable.

4. **Execution**: Finally, the script executes the selected choice using `subprocess.run()` with the chosen command as input.

**Assumptions**

This script assumes that:

* `script_identifier.xsh` exists and outputs valid choices.
* `rofi` is installed and configured on the system.
* The user has read/write access to the execution environment.

Overall, this script provides a simple yet effective way to create a dynamic menu system using existing command-line tools.
