**Helper Function for FZF-URXVT Menu**
=====================================

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOC%23-2024--07-blue)](https://github.com/your-username/fzf-urxvt-menu-helper#v2024-07)

This is a bash script that serves as a helper function to launch an fzf-based menu in urxvt, similar to dmenu.

**Functionality**
----------------

The script takes an arbitrary number of command-line arguments and escapes each one using the `%q` format specifier. It then joins these escaped arguments into a single string, which is used as input for fzf.

The output of fzf is redirected to the terminal where the menu is displayed.

**Usage**
-----

To use this script, simply run it with any desired command-line arguments:
```bash
./fzf-urxvt-menu-helper arg1 arg2 ...
```
This will launch an fzf-based menu in urxvt, allowing you to select from a list of options.

**Configuration**
---------------

No configuration is required to use this script. The behavior can be customized by modifying the `alacritty` command used to launch the fzf menu.

**Requirements**
--------------

* `fzf`
* `urxvt`
* `bash`
