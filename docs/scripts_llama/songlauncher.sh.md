# songlauncher.sh

Let's break down this script.

**Script Type:** Shell Script (written in Bash)

**Purpose:** The script is designed to play a song with the cmus player using the dmenu utility as an interface.

**Components:**

1. `cmus-remote`: This command-line tool is used to control the cmus music player.
2. `-f` option: Specifies that cmus-remote should fetch the next file (song) from its list.
3. `$(find -L music -type f | dmenu -i -l 30)`:
	* `find`: A utility for searching files based on various criteria.
	* `-L music`: Searches within the directory `music` and its subdirectories (`-L` means "follow symbolic links").
	* `-type f`: Only considers files (not directories).
	* `dmenu`: A lightweight, customizable menu system.
	* `-i`: Specifies that dmenu should display an input field to allow user interaction.
	* `-l 30`: Limits the length of the list displayed by dmenu to 30 items.

**Functionality:**

1. The script uses `find` to search for files (songs) within the `music` directory and its subdirectories.
2. The results are piped to `dmenu`, which displays a menu with a list of songs.
3. When the user selects a song using dmenu, the selection is passed as an argument to `cmus-remote -f`.
4. cmus-remote then plays the selected file.

In summary, this script provides a simple way to play music from the `music` directory and its subdirectories using cmus player, with a user-friendly menu interface provided by dmenu.
