# edit_chezmoi_cfg_files.sh

**Script Description and Functionality**

This is a Bash script that uses the `fzf` command-line fuzzy finder to select a file or directory from the output of `chezmoi managed`. The selected item can then be edited using the `nvim` editor.

Here's how it works:

1. **`chezmoi managed`**: This command lists all managed files and directories, which are likely configuration files for your system.
2. **`fzf`**: The script uses `fzf` with various options to create an interactive interface to select a file or directory from the output of `chezmoi managed`.
	* **`--preview`**: This option executes a shell command that generates a preview for each item in the list. In this case, it uses `bat` (a text browser) to display the contents of files and `eza` (a file explorer) to show directory contents.
	* **`--preview-window`**: This option sets up the window where the preview is displayed. In this case, the preview is shown in a right-aligned window with 60% width and wrap-around scrolling enabled.
3. **`selected=$(...)`**: The output of `fzf` (i.e., the selected file or directory) is stored in the `$selected` variable.
4. **`if [ -n "$selected" ]; then ...`**: If a selection was made, the script edits the selected item using `nvim` with the path passed to it.

**In summary**, this script provides an interactive way to select a managed file or directory and edit it in `nvim`.
