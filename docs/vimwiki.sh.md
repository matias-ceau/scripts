**Script Description**

This is a Bash shell script that uses the `fzf` fuzzy finder utility to open a specific note file in the Vim text editor. The script is designed to be run from the command line.

**Functionality Breakdown**

1. **Shebang Line**: The first line, `#! /bin/sh`, specifies the interpreter that should run this script.
2. **Commented Lines**: The commented lines are metadata for documentation and identification purposes:
	* `#DOC#@CLI@` indicates that this script is a command-line interface (CLI) tool.
	* `"Open a note in vim with fzf"` provides a brief description of the script's purpose.
3. **Script Body**:
	* The script uses `ls` to list all files in the `~/notes` directory.
	* The output of `ls` is piped to `fzf`, which presents an interactive interface to select one of the listed files.
	* The selected file path is enclosed in double quotes (`"`) and assigned to a variable using command substitution (`$( )`).
	* Finally, the script uses Vim's built-in editing capabilities to open the selected note file for editing.
