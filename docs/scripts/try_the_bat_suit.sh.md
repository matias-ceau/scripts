# Try The Bat Suit

---

**try_the_bat_suit.sh**: Dynamic file previewer using `bat` and `fzf` for code files with syntax highlighting.

---

### Dependencies

- `bash`: The shell used to execute the script.
- `fd`: A fast and user-friendly alternative to `find`.
- `fzf`: A command-line fuzzy finder.
- `bat`: A `cat` clone with advanced syntax highlighting and more functionalities.
- `rg` (ripgrep): A line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.

### Description

This script is a file previewer designed to enhance your file browsing experience with advanced syntax highlighting. It leverages `fzf` to provide an interactive fuzzy search interface and `bat` for pretty-printed previews of code with syntax highlighting. It can be run by providing a filename as an argument or interactively selecting a file from the current directory. Once a file is selected, you can choose a programming language for syntax highlighting through an interactive selection enabled by `fzf`, using the list of all languages supported by `bat`.

The script uses a secondary function called `preview_cmd` to generate the highlighted preview for the selected file.

### Usage

Run the script in your terminal. You can either pass a file name as an argument to directly preview it, or run the script without arguments to select a file interactively.

```bash
# Direct filename input
./try_the_bat_suit.sh path/to/file.ext

# Interactive mode
./try_the_bat_suit.sh
```

In interactive mode:
1. Use the arrow keys or type to search interactively with `fzf` for a file.
2. Select a programming language for syntax highlighting from the `fzf` list.
3. View the highlighted preview generated by `bat`.

> [!NOTE]
> - The script does not handle cases when `fd` or `fzf` return multiple files; it assumes a single selection.
> - Adding error handling for when `bat` or `fzf` fail would improve the robustness.
> - Currently, the script exports functions and variables which may not be necessary if the script remains self-contained.
> - Consider adding more comments within the script for ease of maintenance and understanding.
