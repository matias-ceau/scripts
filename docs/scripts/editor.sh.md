# editor.sh

**Script Description**

This is a Bash shell script that uses the `find` command to search for files recursively, and then pipes the results to the `fzf` fuzzy finder. The selected file path is then passed as an argument to the `vim` text editor.

**Functionality Breakdown**

1. **`find 2>/dev/null`**: This line searches for files in the current directory and all its subdirectories recursively, ignoring any errors that might occur (the `2>/dev/null` part redirects error messages to `/dev/null`, effectively suppressing them). The `find` command produces a list of file paths.
2. **`| fzf`**: The output of the `find` command is piped to the `fzf` fuzzy finder, which presents an interactive interface for searching and selecting a file from the list.
3. **`vim "$( find 2>/dev/null | fzf )"`**: Once a file is selected using `fzf`, its path is passed as an argument to the `vim` text editor via command substitution (`$(...)`). The `vim` editor will then open with the selected file.

**Context and Use Cases**

This script is likely intended for use in a Unix-like environment, such as Linux or macOS. It provides a convenient way to edit files within the current directory and its subdirectories without having to navigate through them manually using a file manager like Nautilus (on Linux) or Finder (on macOS). The `fzf` fuzzy finder helps users quickly locate files with minimal typing.

Overall, this script offers a simple, yet powerful tool for editing files in a specific directory hierarchy.
