# Sync Repository Script

---

**sync-repo-simple.sh**: A script to synchronize a local Git repository with remote changes.

---

### Dependencies

- `git`: The script assumes that Git is installed and available in the system.

### Description

This script simplifies the process of syncing a local Git repository with its remote. It streamlines fetching updates, managing local changes, and handling conflicts in merges and stashes. The main features include:

- **Real-time Command Execution:** Outputs the command being executed for better debugging and monitoring.
- **Automatic Commit Message Generation:** Generates a concise commit message based on local changes.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Handles both merge and stash conflicts, allowing users to easily choose how to resolve them.
- **Detailed Process Summary:** Provides a summary of what occurred during the sync process, including timestamps and the current state of commits.

The script maintains several helper functions to manage different tasks throughout the synchronization process. These functions include error handling for failed commands, real-time output from commands, and options for the user to select when resolving conflicts.

### Usage

Run this script by passing the path to the desired Git repository as an argument:

```bash
./sync-repo-simple.sh /path/to/your/repo
```

To get help or see usage information, simply include the `--help` or `-h` option:

```bash
./sync-repo-simple.sh --help
```

**Example Command:**

```bash
./sync-repo-simple.sh ~/myproject
```

This command will sync the local `myproject` repository with its remote counterpart.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider adding more robust error handling in cases where the Git commands may fail, such as network issues or permission problems. Moreover, enhancing logging capabilities to log the operations performed by the script could greatly assist in troubleshooting any issues that arise during sync operations.
