# Edit Chezmoi Config Files

---

**edit_chezmoi_cfg_files.sh**: A script to select and edit Chezmoi-managed configuration files with fzf.

---

### Dependencies

- `chezmoi`: This is the primary tool for managing dotfiles and configuration files.
- `fzf`: A command-line fuzzy finder for selecting items interactively.
- `bat`: A cat clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration (used for previewing files).
- `eza`: An enhanced version of `ls` with colored output and icons.
- `nvim`: Neovim, a text editor used to open the configuration files.
- `fd`: A simple, fast, and user-friendly alternative to `find` (used for locating files).

### Description

This script facilitates the editing of configuration files managed by Chezmoi. It allows users to visually select files or directories from their Chezmoi-managed configurations through an interactive fuzzy finder (`fzf`). 

When executed, the script performs the following:

1. It defines two helper functions:
   - `preview_command`: Previews files and directories using `bat` or `eza`.
   - `colorize_file_list`: Colorizes file and directory names for improved readability in `fzf`.

2. The script gathers all files managed by Chezmoi and pipes them into `fzf`, presenting the user with a list to select from. The selected file's path is determined based on the Chezmoi source path and opened with Neovim.

3. After editing, the user is presented with options to apply changes:
   - Apply changes directly to Chezmoi.
   - Sync the changes to a repository.
   - Exit without applying any changes.

### Usage

To use this script, simply run it in your terminal. Hereâ€™s a quick command to execute it:
```bash

/home/matias/.scripts/edit_chezmoi_cfg_files.sh
```

This will launch an interactive file selector powered by `fzf`. You can:

- Navigate directories or files using arrow keys.
- Preview the selected file with the provided custom preview.
- Select a file/directory by pressing `Enter`.

After selecting a file, you will be prompted with options:
```plaintext
- [a] (default): Chezmoi apply
- [s]: Chezmoi apply and sync repo
- [x]: exit
```

You can choose to apply the changes, sync your repository, or exit.

> [!TIP] 
> Consider adding error handling for cases where `chezmoi` commands fail and ensure the script displays helpful error messages. Moreover, including an option for creating or editing new files might enhance its functionality further.
