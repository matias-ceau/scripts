# transform_symlink.sh

**Script Description:**

This is a Bash script that replaces a symbolic link (symlink) with its actual target file. The script takes one argument, which is the path to the symlink to be replaced.

**Functionality:**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the script does:

1. **Argument checking**: The script checks if exactly one argument was provided. If not, it displays usage instructions and exits with a non-zero status code (indicating an error).
2. **Symlink verification**: It verifies that the provided argument is indeed a symbolic link by using the `-L` test. If it's not a symlink, the script reports an error and exits.
3. **Target retrieval**: The script uses `readlink` to retrieve the actual target file of the symlink.
4. **File copying**: The script copies the target file to a new file with the same name as the original symlink using `cp`.
5. **Success message**: Finally, the script displays a success message indicating that the symlink has been replaced with its actual target file.

**Example Usage:**

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g., `replace_symlink.sh`), make it executable with `chmod +x replace_symlink.sh`, and then run it with the path to the symlink as an argument:
```bash
./replace_symlink.sh /path/to/original/symlink
```
This will replace the original symlink with its actual target file.
