### Description

<a name="overview" />

#### Overview

This script is designed to transform a symbolic link into a regular file by replacing the symlink with the actual file it points to. 

When executed, the script performs the following operations:
- It checks if exactly one argument is provided.
- It verifies that the provided argument is a symlink.
- It retrieves the actual file that the symlink points to using the `readlink` command.
- The target file is then copied to the location of the symlink, effectively replacing the symlink with the file itself.

This can be especially helpful in scenarios where maintaining a symlink is no longer necessary, and you need the actual content at that location.

<a name="usage" />

#### Usage

To use the script, you need to run it from your terminal providing a symlink as an argument. For example:

```bash
./transform_symlink.sh /path/to/your/symlink
```

Ensure that you have execute permissions on the script. You can grant execute permissions using:

```bash
chmod +x transform_symlink.sh
```

You may also consider binding this script to a key combination in your window manager if you need quick access.

#### Examples

1. Transform a symlink named `example_link` to its target file:
    ```bash
    ./transform_symlink.sh ~/example_link
    ```
    
2. Attempt to transform a non-symlink will yield an error:
    ```bash
    ./transform_symlink.sh ~/actual_file
    ```

### Notes

- Ensure you have backup copies of important files before using this script as it will overwrite the symlink with the target file.

> **Critique:** The script performs its function well, but there are several potential improvements:
> - Add error handling for cases where the target file might not exist or is inaccessible.
> - Consider allowing users to specify an alternative filename for the copied file to prevent accidental overwrites.
> - Providing more informative error messages can enhance the user experience, particularly when working in diverse environments.
