### Description

<a name="overview" />

#### Overview

The `fzfmenu` script provides a simple way to combine the power of `fzf` with the convenience of an xterm-based interface. When executed, it opens a new xterm window titled 'fzfmenu' and runs the `fzf` command, allowing users to make selections from the terminal input. The output of the selection is directed back to the terminal. 

This is particularly useful for managing lists or quick selections directly from the command line in a user-friendly way. The implementation uses file descriptors to manage input and output seamlessly.

#### Usage

To use the script, simply run it from your terminal. You can also pass additional arguments to `fzf` directly through the script.

```bash
/home/matias/.scripts/fzfmenu.sh [OPTIONS]
```

You might want to assign this script to a keybinding in your window manager (qtile) to invoke it quickly when needed.

#### Examples

1. Launch the fzf menu with no extra options:
   ```bash
   /home/matias/.scripts/fzfmenu.sh
   ```

2. Pass options to customize the fzf experience (e.g., `--height`):
   ```bash
   /home/matias/.scripts/fzfmenu.sh --height 50%
   ```

### Notes

This script is designed to work specifically with xterm. If you are using a different terminal emulator, you may need to adjust the script for compatibility.

> **Critique:**  
> The script could benefit from additional error handling, such as checking whether `fzf` or `xterm` is installed before trying to execute them. Also, consider allowing more customizable options for the terminal appearance or behavior, enhancing user experience and flexibility.
