> [!TIP]  
> Consider implementing missing features such as rendering documentation as PDF or HTML, enabling page up and down for preview navigation, and allowing multiple script selections. Additionally, refining the header customization could enhance the scriptâ€™s adaptability and user experience. Implementing a logger function for better tracking of user interactions could also be beneficial.
