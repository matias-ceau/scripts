# Pacman Fuzzy Search Script

---

**pacman-fuzzy-search.sh**: Fuzzy search and install Arch Linux packages (repo/AUR) using paru and fzf

---

### Dependencies

- `paru`: AUR helper to query and install repo and AUR packages.
- `fzf`: Command-line fuzzy finder for interactive search.
- `bat`: Colorful `cat` clone with syntax highlighting (used for pretty previews).
- `ripgrep` (`rg`): Fast grep replacement, used for filtering results.
- `notify-send`: Used to send desktop notifications.
- `sed`: Stream editor for text processing (standard on most systems).

_Ensure all dependencies are installed, preferably via pacman/AUR. Script assumes a Unix-like environment (Arch Linux), and is suitable for usage with qtile WM and interactive keybindings._

---

### Description

This script enables an advanced fuzzy search for available and installed packages (including AUR) using `paru` as the package interface and `fzf` for selection. It sets up a persistent cache directory, leverages ripgrep for filtering, and bat for syntax-highlighted previews.

**Key Features:**
- **Preview Pane**: Shows detailed package info (`paru -Si` or `paru -Qi`) in a colored panel powered by `bat`.
- **Interactive Search**: Lets you type to search across packages. Results can be filtered between AUR, repo, or installed packages.
- **Multi-select & Install**: Select multiple packages to install at once.
- **Dynamic Reloading**: Under the hood, supports reloads and border label changes (partially implemented, see commented code).
- **Keybind Support**: Suitable for mapping to a key in your qtile config for quick popup access.

#### Functions:
- `preview_cmd`: Displays package details for the selected line in `fzf` using `paru` and formats them for easier reading.
- `paruSl`: Lists all available packages (`paru -Sl`) with some visual tweaks.
- `search_cmd`: Intended to filter results based on togglable "repo" and "installed" modes (partially implemented; see commented logic for future improvements).
- `fzf_cmd`: Runs `fzf` with several custom keybinds and options for a rich TUI search/selection experience.

### Usage

#### Run Directly

```
~/.scripts/bin/pacman-fuzzy-search.sh
```

- Use arrow keys to browse.
- Type to search.
- Space or tab to select multiple packages.
- Press `Enter` to install selected packages (via `paru -S`).

#### Assign to qtile Keybinding

Edit your `~/.config/qtile/config.py`:

```python
Key([mod], "F12", lazy.spawn("~/.scripts/bin/pacman-fuzzy-search.sh"))
```

#### Example - TLDR

```
# Launch fuzzy search for packages
~/.scripts/bin/pacman-fuzzy-search.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> While the script is robust and provides a friendly package search/install workflow, the advanced mode switching (filtering to only AUR, only installed, etc.) is incompleteâ€”referenced via commented code in both functions and keybinding setups. Additionally, customization of border labels and dynamic reloading of results can be enhanced by finishing the commented-out logic.
> 
> The use of `bat` for previewing is visually appealing but may appear cluttered for very long package descriptions. Consider adding more intuitive filtering UI or more keybinds for filtering for a future version.
