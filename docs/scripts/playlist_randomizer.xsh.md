# Playlist Randomizer

---

**playlist_randomizer.xsh**: Randomly selects and plays a playlist of albums in cmus.

---

### Dependencies

- `pandas`: A powerful data analysis library used for handling playlist data.
- `random`: Standard Python module for generating random numbers, utilized for shuffling.
- `os`: Standard library for interacting with the operating system, used here to handle file paths.
- `cmus`: A terminal-based music player that this script interfaces with.
- `dmenu`: A dynamic menu for X, used for selecting playlists from the available options.

### Description

The **Playlist Randomizer** script automates the process of selecting a playlist of albums and playing them in random order using cmus. It leverages `xonsh`, a Python-powered shell that combines shell scripting with Python's capabilities.

Key features of the script include:

- **Playlist Selection**: The script lists all `.m3u` playlists from the user's specified playlist directory (`~/.playlists`). Users can select a playlist using `dmenu`, which is a user-friendly interface for selection.
- **Randomization**: Once the playlist is chosen, the script reads the contents of the playlist file, extracts unique albums, and shuffles their order.
- **Output Creation**: A temporary randomized playlist is created and written to `/home/matias/.temp/randomized.m3u`.
- **Interaction with cmus**: The script communicates with cmus via `cmus-remote`, clearing any existing tracks, adding the new randomized playlist, and initiating playback.

### Usage

To run the script, simply execute it from a terminal:

```bash
./playlist_randomizer.xsh
```

Make sure you have executable permission on the script. You can add the following line to your keybinding configuration in qtile if you want to run it with a keyboard shortcut:

```python
Key([mod], "r", lazy.spawn("/home/matias/.scripts/playlist_randomizer.xsh")),
```

Once executed, the script will display a list of available playlists for selection. After selecting a playlist, the music will play in a randomized order.

> [!TIP] 
> The script assumes that the specified paths and playlists exist. Consider adding error handling for cases where there are no playlists, or the selected file doesnâ€™t exist. Additionally, handling for empty playlists might improve the user experience.
