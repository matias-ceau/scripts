# Git Directory Navigation Script

---

**git_cd.sh**: Quickly navigate to a Git repository directory using a fuzzy finder.

---

### Dependencies

- `bash`: A Unix shell that provides command-line interface handling and scripting capabilities.
- `locate`: A command-line utility used to find the location of files in the system.
- `eza`: A modern replacement for `ls`, provides a colorful and formatted listing of directory contents.
- `fzf`: A command-line fuzzy finder that allows interactive filtering.
- `awk`: A programming language suitable for pattern scanning and processing.

### Description

The `git_cd.sh` script is a Bash script designed to facilitate rapid navigation to Git repositories within your filesystem. It leverages several command-line utilities for locating and selecting repositories visually. The script works by doing the following:

1. **Finding Git Repositories**: It uses `locate` to search for directories ending with `.git`, representing Git repositories.

2. **Formatting Output**: The paths are then cleaned to remove the `.git` suffix and formatted with `eza` for colorful output, improving readability by displaying nested directories with icons.

3. **Fuzzy Finding**: The script employs `fzf` to allow the user to interactively select a directory from the list of repositories.

4. **Change Directory**: Upon selection, it converts the path from a simplified `~` format back to the full user path and uses `cd` to enter the chosen directory.

### Usage

To use the script, simply invoke it from your terminal. Ensure you have set the appropriate permissions for execution. Hereâ€™s how to use the script:

```bash
bash ~/path/to/git_cd.sh
```

Alternatively, you can assign it to a keybinding in your window manager (like qtile):

```python
Key([mod], "g", lazy.spawn("bash ~/path/to/git_cd.sh")),
```

This will allow you to open a fuzzy finder directly for your Git directories when you press the designated key combination.

> [!TIP]  
> Consider adding error handling for the situation where no Git directories are found or if `cd` fails. This could enhance the user experience by providing feedback or error messages when the selected repository path is invalid. Additionally, consider providing a configuration option to limit the search scope to specific directories, which could optimize performance for large filesystems.
