# Quick Password Selector

---

**quick-pass.sh**: Quickly select a password from your password store using `fzf`.

---

### Dependencies

- `fd`: A simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to `find`. Used for listing files within the password store directory.
- `fzf`: A general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder that helps with interactively selecting files from the list.

### Description

This script helps you swiftly locate and select password entries from your password store. It leverages `fd` to list all files within the directory specified by the `$PASSWORD_STORE_DIR` environment variable, which should correspond to your password store path. The absolute paths returned by `fd` are then stripped of the base `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR` path using `sed`, leaving only the relative paths to the password files.

Finally, the list of entries is piped into `fzf`, which will present you with an interactive fuzzy search interface. This allows for quick searching and selection of passwords by their entries.

### Usage

To use the script, simply run it in your terminal. Ensure that your environment variable `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR` is set to the directory where your password store is located.

```bash
export PASSWORD_STORE_DIR=~/.password-store
~/.scripts/quick-pass.sh
```

Make sure that `fd` and `fzf` are installed on your Arch Linux system:
```bash
sudo pacman -S fd fzf
```

You may also want to bind this script to a key combination in qtile for even quicker access.

> [!TIP]
> Currently, the script only lists and lets you select files but doesnâ€™t open or display any content from the selected password. Consider adding functionality that opens the selected file or copies its content to the clipboard securely for convenient password retrieval.
