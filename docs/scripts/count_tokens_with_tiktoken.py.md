### Description

<a name="overview" />

#### Overview

This Python script counts the number of tokens in a specified text file using the `tiktoken` library, which is designed for tokenization in models such as OpenAI's GPT. It utilizes the encoding for the "gpt-4o" model to ensure accurate token counts.

The main functionalities of the script include:
- Reading the content of a file.
- Tokenizing the entire text based on the specified model encoding.
- Returning the total number of tokens counted.

The script is structured to provide a command-line interface where users can easily input the path of the target text file.

#### Usage

To use the script, it must be run from the terminal with the following syntax:

```
python count_tokens_with_tiktoken.py <file_path>
```

- Replace `<file_path>` with the absolute or relative path to the text file you wish to analyze.
- The script will output the number of tokens in the specified file.

Note that the script expects exactly one argument; if none or more are provided, it will display a usage message and exit.

#### Examples

- Counting tokens in a file named `example.txt`:

```
python count_tokens_with_tiktoken.py example.txt
```

Output:
```
Number of tokens: 123
```

### Notes

- Ensure that the `tiktoken` library is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install tiktoken
```

- The script currently only supports UTF-8 encoded text files.

> **Critique**  
> The script efficiently counts tokens, but it could be improved by adding error handling for file not found exceptions. Additionally, providing more detailed output, such as the input file name in the output message, could enhance user experience. 

Consider expanding the functionality to include options for different tokenization models if necessary, allowing users to specify the model as a command-line argument.
