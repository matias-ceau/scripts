# count_tokens_with_tiktoken.py

**Script Description**

This is a Python script that counts the number of tokens in a given text file. The token count is based on the `gpt-4o` model, which is a specific language model used for natural language processing.

**Functionality**

Here's how the script works:

1. **Importing Libraries**: The script imports two libraries: `sys` and `tiktoken`. `sys` is used to interact with the operating system and command line arguments, while `tiktoken` is a library that provides tokenization functions.
2. **Defining the `count_tokens` Function**: This function takes a file path as input, reads the contents of the file, encodes the text using the `gpt-4o` model's encoding scheme provided by `tiktoken`, and returns the length of the encoded tokens array.
3. **Main Execution Block**: The script checks if it was run with exactly one command-line argument (the file path). If not, it prints an error message and exits. Otherwise, it calls the `count_tokens` function with the provided file path and prints the resulting token count.

**Assumptions**

To use this script, you'll need to have:

1. Python installed on your system.
2. The `tiktoken` library installed (you can install it using pip: `pip install tiktoken`).
3. A text file containing the content for which you want to count tokens.

**Example Usage**

Save this script as `count_tokens.py`, navigate to the directory in your terminal, and run it with a single argument: the path to the text file:
```bash
$ python count_tokens.py example.txt
Number of tokens: 1234
```
Replace `example.txt` with the actual path to your text file.
