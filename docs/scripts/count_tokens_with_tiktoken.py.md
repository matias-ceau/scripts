# Token Counter Script

---

**count_tokens_with_tiktoken.py**: This script counts the number of tokens in a file using the `tiktoken` library.

---

### Dependencies

- `tiktoken`: A Python library used to encode text for different models. Ensure it is installed in your Python environment. You can install it via pip:

  ```bash
  pip install tiktoken
  ```

### Description

This Python script reads a file and calculates the number of tokens using the `tiktoken` library, specifically for the "gpt-4o" model. It reads the file content, encodes it into tokens, and then returns the count of these tokens.

The script opens the specified file in UTF-8 encoding to ensure it reads various text formats correctly. The use of `tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4o")` suggests it is aligned with a specific model from OpenAI, which might be significant for processing text in styles or ranges that model supports.

### Usage

To utilize this script, execute it with Python and provide a path to the file you want to analyze. It expects one command-line argument, which is the path to the file:

```bash
python count_tokens_with_tiktoken.py <file_path>
```

Replace `<file_path>` with the path to your target file. For example, to count tokens in `example.txt`, you would run:

```bash
python count_tokens_with_tiktoken.py example.txt
```

The output will be the number of tokens found in the specified file.

> [!TIP]
> - The script currently requires Python 3 environment with the `tiktoken` library installed. Consider checking for these dependencies within the script itself and providing a clear error message if they are missing.
> - There is no error handling for file access issues, such as the file not existing or having permission denied errors. Consider wrapping file operations in a try-except block to handle exceptions gracefully and inform the user accordingly.
> - The script currently only supports token counting for the model "gpt-4o". If support for additional models is desired, consider parameterizing the model selection to make the script more versatile.
