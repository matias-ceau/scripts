### Description

<a name="overview" />

#### Overview

This script is designed to count the number of tokens in a given text file using the Tiktoken library, which is tailored for working with OpenAI's GPT models. It reads the content of the specified file, encodes the text into tokens according to the GPT-4 model's tokenization scheme, and then returns the total number of tokens. This can be particularly useful for developers working with language models, as token limits often dictate API usage and model responses.

The key function in the script is `count_tokens`, which performs the following:
1. Opens the specified file and reads its content.
2. Utilizes the `tiktoken` library to retrieve the appropriate encoding for the "gpt-4o" model.
3. Encodes the text and returns the number of tokens generated.

#### Usage

To execute the script, run it from a terminal with Python, passing the file path of the text you wish to analyze as an argument:

```bash
python count_tokens_with_tiktoken.py <file_path>
```

Make sure to replace `<file_path>` with the actual path to your text file. For example:

```bash
python count_tokens_with_tiktoken.py /home/matias/my_text_file.txt
```

The script will output the number of tokens in the specified file.

#### Examples

```bash
# Count tokens in a file named "example.txt"
python count_tokens_with_tiktoken.py /home/matias/example.txt
# Output: Number of tokens: 150
```

### Notes

- Ensure that the file you are analyzing contains text and is encoded in UTF-8.
- It is essential to have the Tiktoken library installed; you can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install tiktoken
```

> **Critique:** The script effectively counts tokens but lacks error handling for common file issues such as missing files or read permission errors. Adding error handling would improve user feedback and robustness. Consider implementing try-except blocks around file operations to handle exceptions gracefully. Additionally, the script assumes the presence of exactly one command-line argument; enhancing it to provide guidance on other invalid input scenarios could enhance usability.
