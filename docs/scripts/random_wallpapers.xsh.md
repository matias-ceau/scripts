# random_wallpapers.xsh

**Script Description and Functionality**

This is a Unix shell script written in Xonsh, a Unix shell that runs on top of Python. The script's purpose is to randomly select a wallpaper from a predefined list and set it as the background image using the `feh` command.

**Key Components**

1. **Importing Libraries**: The script imports the `os` (operating system) and `random` libraries, which are used for file system interactions and random number generation, respectively.
2. **Setting up File List**: The script defines a variable `folder` pointing to the `/home/matias/./wallpapers` directory, where the wallpaper images are stored. It then uses a list comprehension to create a list of files (`wallpapers`) with `.png` or `.jpg` extensions from this directory.
3. **Selecting Wallpaper**: The script attempts to select a random wallpaper using `random.choice(wallpapers)`. If no selection is made (i.e., the `selection` variable remains empty), it falls back to an empty default value.
4. **Setting Background Image**: Finally, the script uses the `feh` command to set the selected wallpaper as the background image, scaling it to fit the screen.

**Notes**

* The script assumes that there are only `.png` and `.jpg` files in the specified directory.
* If no wallpapers are found in the directory, the script will not raise an error but instead, set an empty background image.
* This script is likely intended for personal use and might not work as-is on other systems without modifications.
