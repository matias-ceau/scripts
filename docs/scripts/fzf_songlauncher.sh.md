# fzf_songlauncher.sh

**Script Description**

This is a shell script written in Bourne shell (`/bin/sh`) that plays a song using the `cmus` music player. The script uses the `fzf` fuzzy finder to select the desired song from a list of files within the `music` directory.

**Functionality Breakdown**

1. **Documentation Comment**: The first line is a documentation comment that provides information about what the script does.
2. **Shebang Line**: The `#! /bin/sh` line specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script (in this case, the Bourne shell).
3. **cmus-remote Command**:
	* `cmus-remote -f`: This command is used to control `cmus` remotely.
	* `-f`: The `-f` option tells `cmus-remote` to play a file.
4. **find and fzf Commands**:
	* `find -L music -type f`: This command searches for regular files (`-type f`) within the `music` directory (recursively, thanks to the `-L` option). The output is redirected to...
	* `fzf`: ...the `fzf` fuzzy finder. It allows the user to select a file from the list generated by the previous `find` command.
5. **Output**: The selected file path is passed to `cmus-remote -f`, which then plays the chosen song.

In summary, this script uses `fzf` to let the user choose a song from their music library, and then plays that song using `cmus`.
