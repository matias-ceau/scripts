# chezmoi_on_a_new_system.sh

Let's break down this script.

**Shebang line**
```
#! /usr/bin/bash
```
This is a shebang line, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script. In this case, it's Bash (the default Unix shell), which is installed at `/usr/bin/bash`.

**The `curl` command**
```bash
"$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply matias-ceau
```
Here, we have a nested command using `curl`. Let's dissect it:

* `"$(..."` is a feature called command substitution (or backticks). It takes the output of the command inside the quotes and uses it as input for the next command.
* `curl` is used to fetch data from a URL.
	+ `-f` tells `curl` to fail silently if there's an issue, rather than printing an error message and continuing.
	+ `-s` suppresses the progress meter.
	+ `-L` follows redirects (in case the original URL returns a redirect).

The URL being fetched is `get.chezmoi.io`, which suggests that this script is interacting with Chezmoi, a configuration manager for Unix-like systems.

**The subsequent commands**
```
-- init --apply matias-ceau
```
These two commands are executed after the data from the `curl` command has been processed by Bash. Here's what they do:

* `-- init`: This command initializes Chezmoi.
	+ The exact behavior depends on how Chezmoi is configured, but this is likely where the initial configuration setup happens.
* `--apply matias-ceau`: This command applies a configuration (or "chezmoi") with the name `matias-ceau`.

In summary, this script:

1. Fetches data from `get.chezmoi.io` using `curl`.
2. Uses the output of that command as input for another command.
3. Initializes Chezmoi and applies a configuration named `matias-ceau`.
