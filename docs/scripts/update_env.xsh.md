# update_env.xsh

**Script Overview**

This script is written in Xonsh, a Unix shell and Python hybrid language. The script's primary function is to update an environment file named `.env` located in the user's home directory (`$HOME/.env`) with API key values stored as environment variables.

**Functionality Breakdown**

The script consists of a single function `update_env()` that performs the following actions:

1. **Extracts API keys**: The function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over all environment variables (stored in the `${...}` object) and filters out only those whose names end with `_API_KEY`. This effectively extracts the API key-value pairs from the environment.
2. **Formats API key content**: The extracted API key-value pairs are then formatted into a string where each pair is on a new line, separated by an equals sign (`=`).
3. **Writes to .env file**: The formatted string is written to the `$HOME/.env` file, overwriting any existing contents.
4. **Calls update_env() function**: Finally, the script calls the `update_env()` function, which executes the above steps.

**Assumptions and Dependencies**

This script assumes that:

* Environment variables with `_API_KEY` suffix are already set in the user's environment.
* The `$HOME` variable is set to point to the user's home directory.
* The Xonsh shell is installed and configured correctly on the system.

Note that this script does not include any error handling or input validation, which might be desirable in a production-ready implementation.
