# script.sh - Fuzzy Menu Automation

---

**/home/matias/.scripts/dev/script.sh**: Opens a fzf menu in an xterm window to type the selection using xdotool

---

### Dependencies

- `xterm` – Terminal emulator to host the fzf menu.
- `xdotool` – Utility to simulate keyboard input.
- `fzf` – Command-line fuzzy finder used to filter and select menu options.

---

### Description

This script is designed to integrate fzf’s fuzzy search capabilities with xterm and xdotool, allowing you to quickly search through given options and have the selected text automatically typed into the active window. The script starts by iterating over all provided arguments, escaping each argument correctly for safe shell usage. After constructing the list of arguments, it launches an xterm window titled “fzfmenu” which executes a bash command that runs fzf with the built-in arguments. The input/output for fzf is carefully redirected using file descriptors to maintain proper interactive behavior. 

Upon selection, the output from fzf is piped directly to xargs which then feeds the selected text as keystrokes to xdotool, effectively typing out the selection. This whole mechanism can be beneficial in a qtile-managed Arch Linux desktop environment, especially when you want to automate text entry based on fuzzy search results quickly.

---

### Usage

The script is intended to be run from the terminal or can be bound to a key in your qtile configuration. You simply pass the list of items or command for fzf to process. For example:

Example command-line usage:
  
  $ /home/matias/.scripts/dev/script.sh "Option1" "Option2" "Option3"

Alternatively, you could assign it to a hotkey in qtile:
  
  keybinding: xterm -e /home/matias/.scripts/dev/script.sh "Item1" "Item2" "Item3"

The selected item from the interactive fzf session in xterm will be automatically typed into the active window.

> [!TIP]  
> One potential improvement is to remove any unused or commented code (such as the earlier hints at using mouse coordinates) to keep the script clean. Additionally, ensuring robust error handling (for instance checking if required dependencies are installed) could enhance the script. It may also be beneficial to parameterize the xterm title or allow custom commands to be executed after selection for greater flexibility.
