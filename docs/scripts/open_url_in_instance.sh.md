# Open URL in Qutebrowser Instance

---

**open_url_in_instance.sh**: Launches a URL in an instance of Qutebrowser.

---

### Dependencies

- `socat`: A command-line based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte streams and transfers data between them.
- `qutebrowser`: A keyboard-driven browser that is designed to be fast and efficient, written in Python.

### Description

The `open_url_in_instance.sh` script is designed to open a specified URL in an existing Qutebrowser instance, leveraging Unix domain sockets for inter-process communication. The script was inspired by Florian Bruhin and developed by Thore Bödecker. 

Key variables in the script include:
- `_url`: The URL to be opened, which is passed as an argument to the script.
- `_qb_version`: The version of Qutebrowser to ensure compatibility; currently set to '1.0.4'.
- `_proto_version`: The protocol version, set to 1.
- `_ipc_socket`: The path to the Qutebrowser IPC (Inter-Process Communication) socket, generated using the user's name.
- `_qute_bin`: The path to the Qutebrowser binary, typically located at `/usr/bin/qutebrowser`.

The main functionality is provided by `printf`, which formats a JSON string containing the URL and relevant metadata. This string is sent through a Unix socket using `socat`. If the communication fails (if there’s no running instance of Qutebrowser), it will open the URL in a new Qutebrowser instance.

### Usage

To use the script, execute it from the terminal with the desired URL as an argument. Here is how you can do it:

```bash
./open_url_in_instance.sh "http://example.com"
```

In case the script fails to send the message to an existing instance (due to no instance being open), it will then fall back to running the Qutebrowser with the URL as an argument.

> [!TIP]  
> The script could be improved by adding error handling for scenarios where the URL is not provided or not valid. Additionally, checking if the Qutebrowser socket exists before attempting to connect could prevent runtime errors. You might want to implement logging to track issues encountered during execution for future troubleshooting.
