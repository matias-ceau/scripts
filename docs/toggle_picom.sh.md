# toggle_picom.sh

**Script Description:**

This is a Bash shell script designed to check if the `picom` window manager is running on a Linux system, and then either stop it or start it with a specific option (`-b`) depending on its current state.

**Functionality:**

The script's main functionality can be broken down into two parts:

1. **Checking the status of picom**: The script uses `pgrep` to search for a running process named `picom`. The `-x` option tells `pgrep` to only match processes whose name exactly matches the specified string (`"picom"`). If such a process is found, its existence indicates that picom is currently running.
2. **Conditional execution**: Based on whether picom is running or not, the script executes one of two branches:
	* If picom is already running, the script prints a message indicating this and then uses `pkill` to stop the running process.
	* If picom is not running, the script prints another message and starts a new instance of picom with the `-b` option using the command `picom -b`.

**Notes:**

* The script's shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`) specifies that it should be executed with Bash.
* The comment block starting with `#DOC#=2024-07=@RUN@ "Check if picom is running"` appears to be a marker for documentation purposes, but its purpose and format are not immediately clear.
